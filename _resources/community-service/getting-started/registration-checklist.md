## General

I, the Trip Leader, have shared the link to my account with my participants and the parents.

As the Trip Leader, I have logged into my account using my account number and password. I have reviewed the information there, including the Pre-Trip Meetings and my camp’s lodging address.

I have at least one adult (age 21 or older) registered for every five participants that are under 21 years.

If I have both boys and girls in my group, I have at least one male adult and one female adult registered.

#### PARTICIPANT INFO SIGN-UP

Using the Participant Info Form tab on my account, the parent/guardian of all my participants that are 17 years or younger have filled out the information and digitally signed.

Using the Participant Info Form tab on my account, every participant that is 18 or older has filled out their information and digitally signed.

I have verified that every participant is on the list, only once, and that their information is correct. (I double-checked age, gender, spelling, skill levels if attending a Workcamp, and used the delete button to get rid of duplicates.)

#### SCREENING AND VERIFICATION

Every participant that is 18 years or older (students too) has had a multi-state/national background check that is no older than 2 years from the start of the mission trip.

Background checks have been seen by the pastor and are safely on file.

Using the Screening and Verification tab (once I’m logged in on my account), I have entered in all 18 and older participants and their background check information.

Within that same tab, I emailed my pastor the link so he/she could digitally sign off on each participant to verify that they have been screened.

#### VEHICLES AND DRIVERS

I verified that all our vehicles, drivers, and insurance information is accurate.<br>I am bringing vehicles that each have a capacity for at least 6 people.<br>My vehicles and drivers are available daily to transport crews during the camp.

#### NOTIFICATIONS TO GROUP FOR SPECIAL REQUESTS

If I have any special requests or situations that I want Group Mission Trips to know about, I have entered those into the special request box in my account. I understand that entering these here is not a guarantee that GMT will accommodate them.
