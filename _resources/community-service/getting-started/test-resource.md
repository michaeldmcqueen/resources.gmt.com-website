## Group Mission Trips’ Screening Requirements:&nbsp;

* Participants that are 18 years of age or older (even students) need to have a national background check on file at your church. These background checks cannot be any older than 2 years from the start of your Group Mission Trip event.
* The check must be clear of 1) Sexual misconduct including crimes resulting in conviction 2) Violence against another person resulting in a felony conviction within the last 10 years 3) Use/distribution of illicit drugs or controlled substances resulting in conviction in the last 10 years 4) Property crime resulting in conviction in the last 10 years
* Pastor’s Signature Required: Once background checks are completed, you’ll login to your customer account and click on the Screening and Verification tab. Type in those participant’s names, their background check organization, and date the check was run. You’ll then follow the instructions there to send your pastor an email to authorize each participant by digitally signing. This needs to be completed at least 30 days before your event starts.&nbsp;

### If your church is NEW to background checks, we recommend...&nbsp;

You may use *any* organization for background checks, just make sure they run national/multi state checks. If you need a recommendation, we like Clear Investigative Advantage\!&nbsp;

They are super easy to work with and offer a great price. Call them to set up a church/organization account (they do not have a sign-up or annual fee) and tell them you are serving with Group Mission Trips\! Their “Basic Starter” package runs a national background check for just $12 per person.&nbsp;

It’s best to call them to set up your account, Clear Investigative Advantage can be reached at 888-242- 2503 option 2.&nbsp;

Plan ahead\! Setting up an account with any background check organization takes time\!&nbsp;

#### Another Background Check Option:

**Not a church or organization?&nbsp;**
