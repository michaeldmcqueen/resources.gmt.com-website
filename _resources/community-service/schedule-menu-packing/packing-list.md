For security reasons, it’s best to leave these items at home. However, we do understand that they are great for capturing moments, sharing life, and communicating back home. If you decide to bring any of these items, don’t let them distract from your experience. How can you be tethered to your devices and expect God to work in unexpected ways? If you decide to bring them, be sure to put them away during the programs and on your project sites.
