Your trip is coming soon\! You have a lot to do to get ready – including packing lists, permission forms, travel details, snack options, and many others.&nbsp;

So many amazing possibilities are ahead of you, including a well-designed mission experience for you and your youth group. These devotions can be the most important part of your preparation because they are designed to get you to think about where Jesus fits into the whole experience. It’s good to pack all the right clothes, toiletries, and snacks – those things will make the week easier. But it’s best to create the space for Jesus to begin to show you something deeper about what is ahead for you. You may find that Jesus is ready to meet you in unexpected ways – and that your journey with him is worth it\!&nbsp;

### DEVOTION \#1: Worth It&nbsp;

As a young girl in rural Zimbabwe, Tererai Trent lived without running water and electricity. Although she was desperate to learn, she only attended two terms of school before she was forced to marry at age 11. In 1991, Tererai met a woman from Heifer International and told her what her greatest dream was: to move to America and get her PhD. The woman told her she should write her dreams down, so Tererai wrote them on piece of paper, placed them in a tin box and buried them under a rock.&nbsp;

By 1998, her dream started to come true. Tererai moved to Oklahoma with her husband and five children. Just three years later, she earned a bachelor’s degree in agricultural education. In 2003, Tererai obtained her master’s degree. After every achievement, Tererai returned home to Zimbabwe, unearthed her tin of dreams and checked off each goal she accomplished, one by one. When Tererai appeared on The Oprah Show in December 2009, she had just realized her greatest dream of all: a doctoral degree. (Oprah.com)&nbsp;

In the first 20 years of her life, Tererai overcame more obstacles to her dreams than most people face in their entire lifetime. It’s difficult to imagine how hard she worked to accomplish her dreams, but step by step she proved that her dreams were worth all the hardships.&nbsp;

How do you decide if something you do is worth it? What makes the effort you’ll put out or the risk you’ll take worthwhile? Just about everything you do requires you to decide if what happens is worth what it takes to get there. Think about the risks and effort it takes to build a friendship with someone. It takes a lot of time to make a friend – what if it doesn’t work out? What if you decide you don’t like each other? Is it worth the time and energy and possible hurt to find a friend? Is it worth it to follow your passion for art, sports, language, education? The question is one that can shape your life, and your future. You’ll make a lot of decisions throughout your life – and many of them will start with your evaluation of whether or not what you will do is worth it.

A person’s actions often reveal what is most important to them. By observing what they do over time, you can see what they value. The same is true for God – you can tell what’s important to him by observing what he has done.&nbsp;

You are worth it to God\! He created you with a specific strategy for good:&nbsp;

“We are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.” Ephesians 2:8-10&nbsp;

What “good things” have you experienced in your life? How was God involved in those good things, or wasn’t he?&nbsp;

How do you respond to the statement that we (including you) are God’s masterpiece?&nbsp;

In a few months, you’ll leave home for a week-long experience of service for others. Only you know the amount of effort you’ll make to show up for the trip, and if the amount of time and energy required during the trip is worthwhile. Could it be that this trip is part of “the good things God planned long ago.”?&nbsp;

**Write down some of the reasons why your mission experience is worth it to you.&nbsp;**

&nbsp;

**Pray, asking God to show you the good he has planned for you to experience\!**

### DEVOTION \#2: Worth It to God&nbsp;

John lived in a country far away from his family for 10 years. When he first moved to the new city, he was overwhelmed. He had a new language to learn and his job was super demanding. He was lonely and it seemed to him that he would never assimilate to the new culture. He missed American TV, the food he usually ate (especially hamburgers), he wanted to be surrounded by familiar friends, but most of all he missed the support of his family. After a month of misery, he called home and told his parents he planned to quit and move home. They were surprised by the news and after a few minutes of awkward conversation, John’s father asked him to delay making a decision for a week and think more about what was missing. John said he would wait a week but asked his parents to help him think about his options.&nbsp;

The next morning, John found 2 messages in his phone. One from each of his parents. Both wrote words of encouragement – that they thought he had the skills to learn the language, the capability to make new friends, and promised they would encourage him every day. His parents considered him to be worth their love. It was worth it to them to start each morning thinking of their son and to send him a message of encouragement. The messages made an impact on his attitude about this new situation – and he chose to stay. Because he was worth it to them, his parents sent a short message of love and encouragement to him each day for the entire 10 years of his time abroad.&nbsp;

Actions reveal what you value. Whatever you consider to be worth your time and effort will get your attention. Everything else is not as important. If you want to know what a person values, take a look at what they do and where they spend their time.&nbsp;

God’s actions show what he values most - his children. David, King of Israel, saw God’s love in action through what he saw of God’s creation…&nbsp;

“You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother’s womb.&nbsp;

Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex\!&nbsp;

Your workmanship is marvelous—how well I know it.&nbsp;

You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion, as I was woven together in the dark of the womb.&nbsp;

You saw me before I was born.&nbsp;

Every day of my life was recorded in your book.&nbsp;

Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed.&nbsp;

How precious are your thoughts about me, O God.&nbsp;

They cannot be numbered\!&nbsp;

I can’t even count them; they outnumber the grains of sand\!&nbsp;

And when I wake up, you are still with me\!&nbsp;

Psalm 139:13-18 New Living Translation (NLT)&nbsp;

David was amazed at the intricacy of his body and God’s design of it.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**What about the human body is most amazing to you?&nbsp;**

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

David writes that God has made a significant investment in you – not only did he craft your body, he also shaped your personality and envisioned your life.&nbsp;

**How does that investment impact your view of:&nbsp;**

**1) Yourself?&nbsp;**

**2) Of other people?&nbsp;**

**3) Of God?&nbsp;**

**Pause for a moment and read Psalm 139:13-18 again. Think about David’s words –&nbsp;**

“You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body and knit me together in my mother’s womb.&nbsp;

Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex\!&nbsp;

**Pray**, expressing your gratitude for God’s creative purpose in creating your body and for the value he gives to you because he made you.

### DEVOTION \#3: “Lost and Found Part 1” 100 sheep&nbsp;

According to the website Apartment Therapy, people have significant problems losing the things that are important to them.&nbsp;

“Forgetting stuff is easy. We’ve all spent mornings frantically searching for our keys or worse, left our phones or wallets behind somewhere. But what’s the real cost of being forgetful?&nbsp;

According to the “Lost & Found” survey released by Pixie, a location app for iPhones, Americans collectively spend a whopping $2.7 billion dollars every year—two thirds of us spending up to $50 yearly— simply replacing the items they can’t find. And that’s not all, the everyday items we often misplace and more importantly, the amount of time we spend searching for them is pretty startling, too. Read ahead for a breakdown of Pixie’s more interesting discoveries.&nbsp;

Not so surprisingly, Pixie’s survey shows that more the 45% of us lose the remote controls to our TVs at least once a week—with 71% of us losing them monthly—making them by far the most misplaced item in the survey. Next come phones (33%); car and house keys (28%); glasses (27%); shoes (24%); and wallets and purses (20%), which means at least one in every five Americans misplaces something important every week\! (From Apartment Living Newsletter)&nbsp;

Believe it or not, Pixie’s research reveals that Americans spend an average total of 2.5 days a year looking for misplaced stuff. That’s nearly half a workweek we lose just searching for things. But time lost isn’t the only costly consequence of being forgetful. The study also shows that 60% of people have either been late to work or school because of lost items, followed by 49% who have missed appointments or meetings, and even 22% who’ve missed flights, trains, or bus rides. Turns out misplacing things can be more than just expensive; it’s a major time drain too.&nbsp;

People losing their belongings has been a problem throughout history. Jesus told three stories in the book of Luke chapter 15. Each of the stories talk about the something that was lost….then found.&nbsp;

Here’s the first story of loss Jesus told: **Read the story in Luke 15:1-7&nbsp;**

“Tax collectors and other notorious sinners often came to listen to Jesus teach. This made the Pharisees and teachers of religious law complain that he was associating with such sinful people—even eating with them\! So Jesus told them this story: “If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, what will he do? Won’t he leave the ninety-nine others in the wilderness and go to search for the one that is lost until he finds it? And when he has found it, he will joyfully carry it home on his shoulders. When he arrives, he will call together his friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.’ In the same way, there is more joy in heaven over one lost sinner who repents and returns to God than over ninety-nine others who are righteous and haven’t strayed away\!” Luke 15:1-7&nbsp;

There is an interesting mixture of people surrounding Jesus when he told this story – the people fit into two groups. 1. Religious leaders. 2. Tax collectors (social outcasts) and notorious sinners.&nbsp;

**Which group would be considered “lost”?&nbsp;**

**Which would consider themselves to be the 99 who stayed with the shepherd? With which of the two groups do you identify?&nbsp;**

If there is a degree of “lostness” for sheep, Jesus seems to be saying something about the value of the one lost sheep compared to the 99 who remained in the flock.&nbsp;

**Why is one lost sheep worth the hassle for the shepherd?&nbsp;**

**Why is the shepherd not satisfied with the 99 sheep that remain with the flock?&nbsp;**

Of course, Jesus is really talking about people who get lost, who get disconnected from God and wander. In John 10:11, Jesus said “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep.”&nbsp;

**Think of a time you felt lost.&nbsp;**

**What happened and how did the situation resolve?&nbsp;**

**How were you found?&nbsp;**

If Jesus is the shepherd, and you’re a sheep, he’s telling you that finding you and holding onto you is important to him. He’ll always look to find you because you are worth it.&nbsp;

The next time you feel like a lost sheep, remember that the good shepherd will not stop looking for you until you are found.&nbsp;

**Pray**\: Jesus, help me see you today. Thank you for looking for me when I am lost\! Help me see your love for all people: the people I don’t know or like or understand, the people who like me or who don’t. Help me see you when life is great and when life is difficult. And help others see you in me.

### DEVOTION \#4: “Lost and Found Part 2” 10 Coins&nbsp;

A few years ago a church denomination held a big conference for youth groups from around the&nbsp;

country at a large University. The conference was amazing – incredible music, activities, speakers, experiences, excursions filled the schedule. On the Saturday the conference ended, the participants took off for the trip home, convinced they’d had a life transforming experience. Since I lived in the town where the conference was held, I was asked to connect with the University that hosted the conference and arrange to pick up all the items that had been left behind. I called the housing department at the school and arranged to meet a person who would give me the lost and found. I was surprised to discover over 1 ton of miscellaneous stuff – a strange assortment of cameras, Bibles, shoes, bathing suits, hats, sunglasses, souvenirs, and a lot of loose change. Dealing with the “lost” stuff was really overwhelming – and trying to find the owner of each item was not easy. Some of the items were costly (like the really good camera) and others had sentimental value as well.&nbsp;

Sometimes we lose things because we’re careless, we forget to pick it up when leaving a space, the item is moved without our knowing, and a lot of other reasons. According to a study by the makers of the Pixie location app, people spend a lot of time trying to find the things they’ve lost…&nbsp;

**The objects people spend more than 15 minutes looking for:** “Of all the everyday items that frequently go missing, it seems that some actually take longer than others to locate. According to Pixie, the average search for a misplaced item takes about five minutes and twenty seconds of our time, but there are things that people spend a lot more time looking for. In fact, the study shows that there are several objects people spend more than fifteen minutes of their day trying to find, including: house keys (21.3%); wallets (20.2%); umbrellas (19%); passports (18.9%); drivers licenses (18.8%); and credit and debit cards (18.7%). That’s a whole lot of time and energy wasted on searching for stuff we need.”&nbsp;

**What’s the most valuable thing you’ve lost in your life?&nbsp;**

**How hard did you look for it after you lost it?&nbsp;**

**Did you find it – or is it still lost?&nbsp;**

**How did you search for it? If you found it, how did you feel about your find?&nbsp;**

**If you didn’t find it, was it replaceable? How did the loss impact you?&nbsp;**

When we look for our lost things, it’s because it’s worth it to us to spend the time and hassle to find it.&nbsp;

Jesus was good at connecting human experience to lessons about God’s love for his people. In the previous devotion we looked at a story he told about a shepherd looking for 1 wandering sheep out of his flock of 100. In this devotion, we’ll look at a story of a women who lost 1/10th of her wealth….&nbsp;

“Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one. Won’t she light a lamp and sweep the entire house and search carefully until she finds it? And when she finds it, she will call in her friends and neighbors and say, ‘Rejoice with me because I have found my lost coin.’ In the same way, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels when even one sinner repents.” Luke 15:8-10&nbsp;

**What is your reaction when you find something valuable you had lost?&nbsp;**

**What is God’s response when a lost person is found?&nbsp;**

Jesus described a woman who was desperate to find the money she’d lost. She went to clean her home and systematically search all her belongings in order to find it.&nbsp;

Jesus said the woman was so relieved and excited when she found the coin that she invited all the people she knew to her house and asked them to celebrate her find. Jesus equated her excitement with God’s pleasure when a person lost to him turns back to him. Read the passage again. What is Jesus saying about the value God places on people who are lost?&nbsp;

The two stories reveal that God thinks every person is worth his attention and love. Like the shepherd who looks for and finds a lost sheep and the woman who went to great lengths to find a lost coin, God will look for and find you. He won’t give up on you, even if you give up on yourself.&nbsp;

**Read this quote:** “When we sin and mess up our lives, we find that God doesn’t go off and leave us— he enters into our trouble and saves us.” (Eugene Peterson, writing in A Long Obedience In The Same Direction.)&nbsp;

**What is your usual reaction when you see something that’s a mess?&nbsp;**

**When your life has been messy, what’s been your normal way to cope?&nbsp;**

**When a friend’s life gets difficult, how have you tried to help?&nbsp;**

**How have you experienced Jesus dealing with a mess in your life?&nbsp;**

You’ve thought about the first two “lost and found” stories Jesus told in Luke 15. You’ll experience the third story while on your mission trip experience this year and discover how you are ‘Worth It”.&nbsp;

**Pray**\: Tell Jesus about what it means for you to follow him – how messy your faith can become. (He already knows about the mess, but it’s good for you to talk with him about it). Let Jesus assure you of his love for you – and listen to him as he encourages you to walk with him.

### DEVOTION \#5: First Things First&nbsp;

It’s an old saying, but still true – “firsts thing first”. Huh? What does that mean? One dictionary gives this definition: “You say ‘first things first’ when you are talking about something that should be done or dealt with before anything else because it is the most important.” (Collinsdictionary.com)&nbsp;

Author Gary Keller asks a question in his best-selling book\*: “What’s the ONE Thing you can do such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?” It’s another way of saying do the first thing first. (\* The One Thing. 2002-2020 Rellek Publishing Partners, Ltd.)&nbsp;

It’s challenging to figure out that “one thing” that orients your life. There are so many different choices to be made and it seems everyone has an idea for what is best. You may have wrestled with the question of what are the “first things first” for a long time – and it’s good for you to do that. It’s a central idea that will guide the decisions and direction for your life.&nbsp;

One of the main characters in the New Testament was a man named Paul. He was well educated and had a strong reputation within the Jewish community. He made sure people did the right thing according to his religion– or else. His “first things first” was to enforce religious laws on people. He was especially ruthless when it came to pursuing and punishing people who followed Jesus – some of whom were killed because of their belief. Then he met Jesus and his “first things first” changed dramatically. After meeting Jesus, he wrote: “Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ and become one with him…I press on to possess that perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me.” Philippians 3:8- 9a, 12b&nbsp;

In these verses, Paul wrote about the shift in his thinking to what he considered to be worth his effort, passion, his life.&nbsp;

**What might Paul say makes up the “infinite value of knowing Christ”?&nbsp;**

**What would you say is the value of knowing Jesus?&nbsp;**

**What does it mean to “become one with him”?&nbsp;**

**How can you “press on” toward Christ?&nbsp;**

Your trip this summer will give you a glimpse into what it means to serve others. It will give you a taste of what it means to follow Jesus. You’ll meet new people (some of whom may become friends) and you’ll be challenged in many unexpected ways. Most of all, you’ll discover that you are worth it to God – and his love for you is unshakeable.&nbsp;

**Pray**\: Take a moment to ask God to remind you of how he has moved in your life. Ask him to prepare you for your trip this summer by giving you what you need for personal strength, relationships, service, and any other situations you will face. You can trust him to meet you where you need him most because you are worth it\!
