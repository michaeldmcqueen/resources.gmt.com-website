### Is there a required Adult to Youth ratio? Can extra Adults go?&nbsp;

Yes, you must have 1 adult (21 years of age or older) for every 5 youth (20 years of age and under). If both boys and girls are registered in your group, you must have at least one male adult and one female adult registered for supervision at night.&nbsp;

* If you have extra adults over your 1-to-5 ratio, they can be part of your group or, if staff positions are open at your location, they have the option of serving on staff without paying the registration fee. Information about staff positions can be found on [GroupMissionTrips.com](https://GroupMissionTrips.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} under Join Our Team.&nbsp;

### Are Background Checks Required?

* Yes, Group Mission Trips requires that all participants 18 years of age or older be screened and background checked by your church prior to attending.&nbsp;
* Background checks must be national and no older than two (2) years from the start of the mission trip. You choose your background check organization vendor or we do have a recommendation.&nbsp;
* 18-20 year olds are not considered “adults” during camp, however because of our commitment to safety, we still ask them to go through your church’s screening process and have background checks run.&nbsp;
* GMT requires a digital pastor signature on our Screening and Verification Form for every 18+ participant in order for them to attend the mission trip.&nbsp;
* Group Mission Trips requires a digital pastor signature on our Screening and Verification Form for every 18+ participant in order for them to attend the mission trip.&nbsp;
* You may use any organization to run your background checks, but if you are looking for a reliable one, we recommend Clear Investigative Advantage. Their basic background checks start at just $12. They can be reached at 1.888.242.2503.&nbsp;

### What about transportation?

* Groups must provide transportation to and from the mission trip as well as daily to and from the sites.&nbsp;
* All vehicles must be available for transportation to and from the sites. (Mileage or fuel costs are not reimbursed for any transportation costs.)&nbsp;
* Vehicles with a minimum capacity of six passengers are requested, with seat belts. While adults will be driving their vehicles, they typically will not be transporting a crew that includes their own youth members. Typically, the youth from your group will be traveling in other vehicles with their crews.&nbsp;
* Due to rough terrain and narrow roads, there are some locations that are labeled “Not Bus Accessible”. If you are serving at one of these, you’ll need to plan on bringing smaller vehicles.&nbsp;
