### Is there a required Adult to Youth ratio? Can extra Adults go?&nbsp;

Yes, you must have 1 adult (21 years of age or older) for every 5 youth (20 years of age and under). If both boys and girls are registered in your group, you must have at least one male adult and one female adult registered for supervision at night.&nbsp;

1. If you have extra adults over your 1-to-5 ratio, they can be part of your group or, if staff positions are open at your location, they have the option of serving on staff without paying the registration fee. Information about staff positions can be found on [GroupMissionTrips.com](https://GroupMissionTrips.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} under Join Our Team.&nbsp;
