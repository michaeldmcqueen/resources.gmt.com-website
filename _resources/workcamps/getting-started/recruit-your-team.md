Surround yourself with a great team\! We have learned over the years that a mission trip is best accomplished through teamwork. Between you, your leadership team and our support–you can lead your students on an incredible, and incredibly organized, mission experience\!

Believe it or not, there are adults right in your own church, and probably in your youth ministry, who would be thrilled to help. They may even excel in areas where you struggle, so get them on your team now\!

Tips on recruiting your leadership team:

* Personally invite specific people to join your team. People best respond to a personal invitation compared to an announcement in the bulletin or a mass email. Give them a call, or better yet, treat someone to a coffee to share your excitement. Tell them why you think they’d be a great addition to the leadership team.
* Give your leadership team responsibility and authority. Once you have asked for help, let them know they can take the reins on specific tasks to make it happen. Also allow them the freedom to lead in their own way. Give leaders plenty of time so they can do their best and feel empowered by you.
* Recruit students to help. No one knows your student’s natural gifts and abilities better than you, so trust them with responsibilites of their own.
* Meet often. Whether it’s a 20 minute touch base before a youth group meeting or a separate meet-ing time all together, keep your mission trip team in the loop. Regular time spent together will help your team bond and automatically improves communication.
* Snacks and refreshments are always a bonus for any team meeting\!
