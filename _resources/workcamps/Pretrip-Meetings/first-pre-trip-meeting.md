Have this meeting as soon as possible and invite all interested participants\!

**BEFORE THE MEETING**

Make sure all your participants meet the age requirements to attend\!

* Jr High/Sr High camps: At least 12 years old or entering the 7th grade in the fall.
* Senior High only camps: At least 14 years old or entering the 9th grade in the fall.
* Important adult/youth ratio: You must bring 1 adult (21 or older) for every 5 youth (20 years of younger).

Have up, and log-in to, your customer account online to help field any questions. Make note of what your camp location has requested for their Community Gift (under the Schedule, Menu and Packing tab). Print out any posters, parent letters, or fundraising ideas from the Helpful Resources tab.

Create a simple handout for participants, parents and adults that provides the dates (including travel), location, and the link to your customer account. Distribute these at your meeting and consider sending it by email as well\!

Plan to show the Group Workcamps promo video or the Youth Expectation Video (both located in the Helpful Resources tab) and the Program video (located under the Program Info tab) from your customer account. Make sure everything is working well.

**MEETING CONTENT:**

Say: *Welcome to our Mission Trip meeting\! We are heading to (your mission trip location) this summer during (your dates). This trip will create long lasting memories –it’s an adventure there we’ll meet people who are in need and we’ll be able to make a real difference in their lives. On top of that, we’ll make friendship connections with people from all over the country, deepen our connection with Jesus, and have an awesome time together\! It’s a big deal, so let’s watch this video to get a visual.* (Play the Group Workcamps promo video or the Youth Expectation Video).

(Another way to build excitement is to invite a couple kids, or adults, who have been on a Group Mission Trip before to share about their experience.)

Say: *This mission trip is not only fun, it’s a way for you to get your friends involved in our group, and in service as well. Grab one of the fliers about our trip and personally invite them to join you\!*

&nbsp;

Introductions and Itinerary

Say: *We want to be sure that everyone knows what’s happening for our mission trip, so let’s go through some of the important details:*

&nbsp;

&nbsp;FIRST PRE-TRIP MEETING

* Dates: Go through departure and arrival dates and times. Ask parents and teens alike to put those details into their calendars. (Project a calendar to give a visual of the timeframe if possible.)
* Wednesday afternoon free time: Let everyone know there is free time during the middle of the week and, if possible, put together a team of volunteers who are willing to research some fun options to present to the group.
  * Lodging: Using the Lodging tab and the Packing List (under the Schedule, Menu and Packing tab) in your customer account, talk about where you’ll be staying and what everyone will need to bring.
* Financial stuff: Talk about the total cost for each person to participate (include transportation, registration, and free time expenses). Discuss fundraising opportunities (if any) and establish a schedule for payment. GMT payment due dates are March 15th and May 15th. (Be sure to set your payments dates earlier so that you can submit payments to GMT on time.)&nbsp;
* Community Gift: Share with everyone the donation items your camp location has requested (located under Packing in the Schedule, Menu and Packing tab). Present (or develop together) a plan for how to collect these items and get them to camp with your group.&nbsp;
* Background Checks: You will need to run national criminal background checks for every participant that is 18 or older by the time of your camp (yes, even students\!). (If a camper turns 18 within 2-3 weeks of the beginning of camp, you don’t need to run one on them). Make a list of who will need a background check and work on a plan to have those completed soon.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Say: *That’s a lot of stuff\! Make sure you have the important dates in your calendars – and get excited\! One more thing – the daily programs are set up for you to participate in a lot of ways:*

* *Worship team–you are welcome to take your instruments along and play with the music team and singers are welcome too\! The Song List for camp is in your customer account for those who want to participate* (under Program tab).&nbsp;
* *Drama–you can volunteer for a drama and can read Scripture or pray during the evening programs.&nbsp;*
* *Variety show–On Wednesday night, there is a variety show at camp\!* If you want to try out for the show, talk to me about your act ( you will need to approve their act before they try out for the variety show when at camp).&nbsp;

Say: *That’s all the information I have for you today\! What questions do you have?* (Use the FAQs in your customer account to help you field any questions.)

Tell them when you’ll meet again as a team and close in prayer.&nbsp;
