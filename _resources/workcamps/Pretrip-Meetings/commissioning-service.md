**Scripture Reading: Matthew 22:37-40&nbsp;**

**LEADER**\: As you embark on this mission trip, these two commandments from Jesus come together as one. As you’re fully physically, spiritually and mentally present with others, you express the love of God with your whole self. As you learn and grow from the experience, your neighbor’s life becomes intertwined with yours. The love of God will be experienced by both you and your neighbor.&nbsp;

**TEAM MEMBERS:** We go to be present with one another and with those we will serve and serve with.&nbsp;

**CONGREGATION:** Love God. Love your neighbor.&nbsp;

**TEAM MEMBERS:** We go to make a change for good in our own lives and in the lives of others.&nbsp;

**CONGREGATION:** Love God. Love your neighbor.&nbsp;

**TEAM MEMBERS:** We go to experience the love of God in new and powerful ways.&nbsp;

**CONGREGATION:** Love God. Love your neighbor.&nbsp;

**LEADER:** We as the congregation of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, committed to God’s mission in our own community and throughout the world, commit ourselves to daily, specific prayer for each member of this team during their journey.&nbsp;

**CONGREGATION:** As you go, we go with you. We will keep you present in our prayers as you live out the commandments of loving God and loving our neighbors.&nbsp;

**LEADER AND CONGREGATION:** May the grace, peace, and wisdom of the Lord Jesus Christ go with you as you serve.&nbsp;

**TEAM MEMBERS:** We love you God. Use us for your service.&nbsp;

**ALL:** Amen.&nbsp;
