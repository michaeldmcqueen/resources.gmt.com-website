> The purpose of this event is to introduce your group to the work crews they’ll experience while on a Group Mission Trip --and to give them a taste for serving others. You are invited to modify this experience to fit your setting–the sky (and your church budget and time constraints) is the limit\!

**BEFORE THE MEETING**

* All adult leaders are needed for this meeting\! (This experience will help them know how to lead while on your mission trip.)&nbsp;

* Prepare crews: Divide your group into crews of six people, with at least one adult per crew. If your group size isn’t easily divisible by six, crews of five are fine, too. Assign each crew a number, starting at one and going up as high as needed. Post these crew lists on the door or walls when people arrive.&nbsp;

* Plan ahead for service: For best results, begin to plan weeks before this event. Find enough service projects within your church facility for each crew to have their own project to complete within 30 minutes or so. Any type of service will work–cleaning, painting, office work, sorting supplies, straightening storage closests..OR serve outside your facility doing yard work for elderly members, small home repairs, volunteer at a local non-profit--the possiblities are endless\!&nbsp;

* Communicate projects: Write up and print a brief description of what each numbered crew will be doing, include the location and supplies needed as well.&nbsp;

* Support the event: Invite extra adults to “float” from project to project to support and answer any questions. Let these coaches know that their job is NOT to do the work, but to be there to offer advice and encouragement.&nbsp;

* Supplies\! Have needed supplies in place at each location.&nbsp;

* Print:

  1. “Crew Roles” sheets (page 3 of this) –one sheet for each participant.

  2. “Devotion Leader Questions” (page 4 of this) –one per crew.&nbsp;
