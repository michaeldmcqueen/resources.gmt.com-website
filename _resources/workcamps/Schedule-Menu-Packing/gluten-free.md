We have listed below some possible options from our menu that may work for you. (Please note: Group Mission Trips cannot guarantee that cooking surfaces or utensils have not been in contact with gluten, so the very best way to be safe is to bring food with you.)<br>Anything marked (\*) may contain gluten additives, double check with our camp staff about those.
