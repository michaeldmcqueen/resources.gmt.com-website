> The only tools at camp are those that YOU bring\! There’s a chance you may not use all the tools you bring, but it’s better to have a tool you don’t need than to need a tool you don’t have\!&nbsp;
>
>
> Tools are often shared so be sure to label all tools with your name and church.&nbsp;
>
>
> Flying to camp? You’re still going to need tools\! Plan to either ship ahead or purchase upon arrival. You can donate your tools to your resident or ship them back.&nbsp;
>
>
> We don’t expect you to buy tools brand new–try to borrow or buy them used. If you do purchase tools, keep receipts in case something doesn’t get used.&nbsp;
