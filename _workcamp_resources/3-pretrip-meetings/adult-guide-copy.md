**Adult Guide**

Welcome to the Adventure!

First of all—thank you!<br>You’re giving your time, energy, and heart to help teenagers experience a life-changing week of faith and service. Because of you, they’ll grow closer to God, make lasting memories, and discover what it truly means to live out love in action.

So buckle up—this week is going to be unforgettable!

**Our Statement of Faith**

We believe the Bible is the inspired, authoritative Word of God. We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, in his virgin birth, in his sinless life, in his death on the cross, in his bodily resurrection, in his ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in his personal return. We believe people receive forgiveness of sins and eternal life through Jesus.

That’s the foundation for everything we do.

**Our Story**

It all started in the early 1990s with a simple mission: *to serve communities and connect people with Jesus through hands-on service.*

From those humble beginnings, Group Mission Trips—part of the non-profit ministry Group Cares—has grown into a movement. Together, volunteers like you have served millions of hours helping people across the U.S. and beyond.

Through it all, one thing has never changed:

We believe the best way for teenagers to encounter Jesus is by serving others—across town or across the globe.

That legacy continues with you.

---

**Our Home Base**

We’re based in beautiful Fort Collins, Colorado, but our mission reaches far beyond state lines.

---

**Our Mission**

To serve others through home repair and community service experiences that transform communities and help participants, residents, and partners grow closer to Jesus.

---

**Our Priorities**

Connecting people with Jesus is the number one goal of Group Mission Trips, and we also focus on the following priorities:

* Safety
* Faith-building activities
* Meaningful projects

---

**FAQs (a.k.a. What You’re Probably Wondering)**

Why Group Mission Trips?<br>Because everything—from housing to projects to worship—is already planned. That means you can focus on what really matters: walking alongside your students on their faith journey.

---

**What’s My Role?**

You’re more than a chaperone—you’re a mentor, encourager, and example of Christ’s love.

Here’s what that looks like:

* Be a positive role model for teens from all over the country
* Work together with both your group and your work crew throughout the trip
* Cheer students on—but don’t do the work for them
* Ensure your group is where they are supposed to be and when they are supposed to be there
* Stay alert for anything unsafe or concerning

---

**What Kind of Work Will I Do?**

Expect to roll up your sleeves! You might:

* Paint (interior or exterior)
* Repair porches and steps or railings
* Build or repair wheelchair ramps
* Install mobile home skirting
* Do light construction or weatherization

No construction experience? No problem! You’ll learn as you go.<br>Crew and project assignments are revealed the first night of camp, and you will receive printed guides to help you with your site. There will be construction savvy volunteers, called **site coaches**, that will come around to each site to help you.

**Pro tip**: Bring work gloves, sunscreen, a hat, and a great attitude!

---

**Who’s on My Crew?**

Each person is assigned to a six-person crew that usually includes one adult and five teens, all from different churches.<br>This mix helps build leadership, friendships, and a sense of wider community.

(If you have questions about this process or have specific requests, please give us a call. If needed, we are happy to keep your group together, but still on work crews of 6 people.)

---

**Where Will I Stay?**

You’ll likely stay in a local school—simple but full of heart!

Expect:

* Sleeping on a twin air mattress, cot, or pad (whatever YOU bring)
* Shared space with up to 400 mission-minded youth and adults
* Limited A/C – many facilities simply don’t have it
* Limited hot water. Local facilities do their best, but we have a lot of participants!
* Showers in the school locker rooms or nearby facilities if needed. When necessary, refreshingly cool shower tents could be constructed outside
* Be prepared for communal living…. there may not be a whole lot of privacy

**Pro tip:** Earplugs, flip-flops for showers, and an extension cord make a big difference!

---

**What Should I Bring?**

Your trip leader will provide a full list, but highlights include:

* Twin-sized air mattress or cot (no doubles or queens)
* 5-gallon water jugs and family-sized coolers (one of each per six people)
* First-aid kit for each vehicle
* Tools from the provided Tool List

---

**Your Key Responsibilities**

* Know and follow the daily schedule
* Be an encourager; your attitude sets the tone
* Participate fully in programs and devotions and ask your students to join you in this journey. Be on hand after programs and devotions for those who may need more attention
* Keep youth supervised and safe at all times
* Report inappropriate or unsafe behavior immediately
* Treat everyone with respect and dignity
* Model modesty and discuss expectations beforehand
* Ensure your driver’s license and insurance are current (if driving)
* Follow the Code of Conduct—it applies to everyone

---

If an issue arises:

1. Address it calmly and privately, never in front of others.
2. Talk with the youth leader if it involves another group.
3. Contact Group Mission Trips staff if you need support.

---

* Let students take the lead as Devotion Leader or Work Director

* Always know where every crew member is
* Encourage hydration and teamwork
* Be the crew’s chief encourager—celebrate every win!

* Free Time: Most afternoons + a free Wednesday afternoon (Dinner is on your own)
