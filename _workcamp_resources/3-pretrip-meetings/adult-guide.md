> THANK YOU for accepting the responsibility of providing teenagers a life-changing week to grow closer to God. We appreciate you taking your time to serve others. Now get ready for an unforgettable and transforming experience\!

**OUR STATEMENT OF FAITH:&nbsp;**

We believe the Bible is the inspired, authoritative Word of God. We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, in his virgin birth, in his sinless life, in his death on the cross, in his bodily resurrection, in his ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in his personal return. We believe people receive forgiveness of sins and eternal life through Jesus.&nbsp;

**OUR HISTORY:&nbsp;**

With humble beginnings going back to the early 1990s, Group Mission Trips has been working with and helping communities across the United States and the world. As the non-profit mission ministry of Group Cares, we work hard to bring meaningful service to the communities we serve. Since our beginning, thousands upon thousands of mission trip participants have racked up millions of volunteer hours serving people in need.&nbsp;

All these years later, one constant remains true: We strongly believe in providing opportunities for teenagers to encounter Jesus through serving others either in their own backyard or halfway across the globe. The Group Mission Trips legacy of lasting impact continuesâ€¦&nbsp;

**OUR OFFICE:&nbsp;**
