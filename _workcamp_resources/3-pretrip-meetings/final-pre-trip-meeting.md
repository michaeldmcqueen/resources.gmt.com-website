We suggest you have this meeting a month and a half before your mission trip starts.

This meeting ensures your entire group is fully prepared, informed, and excited to serve. By the end, everyone should know what to bring, what to expect, and how to get their hearts ready for a life-changing experience.

### **Meeting**

**Say**: Welcome everyone! We are just weeks away from stepping into an incredible week of serving through home repair. You’ve already experienced what it’s like to work on a project together during our crew simulation—using our crew roles, working through challenges, and relying on one another. Now we’re going to take that excitement and pair it with practical preparation so that we can serve well, stay safe, and be spiritually ready.

### **Itinerary/Finances**

· Share specific departure and return dates, times, and travel plans

· Provide your cell number and your adult leaders’ numbers.

· Discuss Wednesday free time, meals, or any extra activities. Clarify if extra funds or release forms are necessary.

· Give a fundraising progress update and what still needs to be completed.

### **Lodging**

• Give each family the lodging address and instructions on how they can send mail to participants during camp.

• Explain that closer to the trip, contact information for camp staff will be available if there’s an emergency.

• Remind everyone: *“This is a mission experience—not a vacation.”* Mention AC, sleeping arrangements, and showers with the mindset of service and sacrifice.

### **What to Bring**

* Hand out and review the Packing List in detail.
  * Remind everyone that they will be sleeping on the floor and will need to bring a single-sized air mattress (unless otherwise noted on your Lodging Info).
  * Sturdy shoes/Work boots
* Give an update on the community gift donations you are bringing as a group. Do the parents need to help with this?
* Review what NOT to bring.
  * Group Mission Trips staff will not be policing dress during the camp, they will be focusing on participant safety and spiritual growth. GMT recommends all participants wear modest clothes that are appropriate in every situation and will not embarrass anyone.
  * **Say**: Our goal is to put our faith in action by serving this community and showing them Jesus’ love. The community will expect our dress and behavior to be different as Christians and they will take notice. Let’s not let how we are dressed distract us from our goal! Please pack plenty of t-shirts, longer shorts or pants, modest swimsuits, and sturdy shoes or work boots for the work sites.
  * Thank parents for their support in this.
* Talk about how your group is doing with the Tool List.
  * Discuss how the collection of these items is going and how/if parents can help.

### **Code of Conduct & Release Agreement**

• Show the Code of Conduct and Liability & Release Agreement (located in your customer account).

• Remind everyone that signing the Participant Info Form means they agree to these terms.

• Discuss any church-specific rules or expectations.

**Say**: On our mission trip, our goal is not just to fix homes—it’s to reflect Jesus in everything we do. The way we speak, act, and treat others is just as important as the work we complete.

### **Questions**

Field any questions and close in prayer.
