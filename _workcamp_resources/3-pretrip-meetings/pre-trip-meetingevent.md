The purpose of this event is to introduce your group to the work crews they will experience while on a Group Mission Trip –and to give them a taste for serving others. You are invited to modify this experience to fit your setting–the sky (and your church budget and time constraints) is the limit!

### **Meet Your Crew, Choose Your Role, and Serve!**

**Say**: “Today you are stepping into your mission trip experience! You are sitting with your mission trip crew—the people you will serve alongside this summer. Each crew will work together to complete a serving project that blesses someone in our community. This isn't just practice. This is real impact.”

---

### **Introduce & Assign Roles**

* Have each person share their name + one thing they hope to get out of the mission trip. Then read through the Crew Roles sheet and decide roles.
* Give 10 minutes to connect and prepare.
* Keep track of time and keep the groups talking. Give a warning when there are 5, 3, and 1-minute left. Pass out the list of the assigned projects to each crew.

### **Serve At Your Project**

· Hand each crew their *Crew Project Card.*

**Say**: “You’re about to serve real people today. They may never meet you, but they will feel your love through what you prepare. Your crew roles matter—use them to accomplish your mission. You have 30 minutes to complete your project. If you finish early, return here for next steps.”

**Encourage adults to float between crews to support and encourage, not do the work.**

---

### **Unpacking Service**

* Talk to and encourage each crew as they return. Give the creatively titled “Devotion Leader Questions” to the crew’s devotional leader and tell them they have about 15 minutes to lead a conversation with their crew using the questions.

**Say** something like: *Everything you just did has a purpose. Today we served people we may never see face-to-face, just as we’ll do on our mission trip. Serving isn’t about tasks—it’s about people and God’s heart for them.”*

* Ask devotion leaders to close in a brief prayer with their crews.

### **Crew Roles**

**ON THIS SUMMER’S MISSION TRIP**: Crews are typically made up of six people; four or five teenagers and one or two adults. You will most likely be on a crew with people from different churches‑it’s a great chance to make new friends! Each crew member fills one of these roles:

* BREAK MAKER—Gathers lunch items and water for the crew. The break maker also schedules break times and makes sure the crew drinks plenty of water.
* PROGRESS REPORTER—Reports back each day to mission trip staff about the crew’s project progress.
* WORK DIRECTOR—Helps match crew skills with the work that needs to be accomplished, coaches and encourages the crew, and requests materials needed for the project.
* ORGANIZER—Keeps the crew organized, gets the crew to the right vehicle each morning, and takes charge of the crew’s first-aid kit and crew packet. Also gets crew members talking in the vehicles.
* DEVOTION LEADER—Keeps the crew focused on connecting to Jesus by leading prepared daily devotions. Encourages the crew to share God Sightings in evening programs.
* QUARTERMASTER—Is in charge of the tools and supplies your crew will need for your assigned project.

**FOR TODAY’S PROJECT**: Here are the assignments for each crew role:

* BREAK MAKER—At some point during your service, report to \[location of snacks\] to get a snack tray for your group. Have your group take a quick break and then get back to work.
* PROGRESS REPORTER—Your job will be to let me know upon your return whether or not your crew got your job done, and, if not, what tasks still need to be finished.
* WORK DIRECTOR—You’ll be responsible for leading and coaching your crew to get your job done today.
* ORGANIZER—You’ll lead your crew from this room to your project location (if changing rooms) and keep an eye out for any safety and any first-aid needs.
* DEVOTION LEADER—You’ll lead a brief discussion after you return from serving. I’ll give you those questions when you get back.
* QUARTERMASTER—You’ll be in charge of the supplies needed to complete your job. The supplies are all ready to go at your location, but you’ll be in charge of distributing them and making sure they are put back in an orderly fashion.

### **Devotion Leader Questions After the Service Project**

· What emotions or thoughts did you experience while serving?

· Was there a moment your role either helped or challenged you? What did you learn from that?

· How does assembling items for people you may never meet teach us about serving with the heart of Jesus?

· Read Galatians 5:13. What does it mean to *serve humbly in love*? How is that different from just doing something “good”?

· How might God use our simple acts of service to change lives—others’ and our own?

### **Closing Word**

**Say**: “Today you didn’t just practice serving—you actually served. The bags you put together are going to people who need hope, comfort, and reminders that they are not forgotten. This is what our mission trip is all about—loving people the way Jesus loves us. Today was just the beginning.”
