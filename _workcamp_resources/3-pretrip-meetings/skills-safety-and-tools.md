##### **Giving your group hands-on confidence to serve safely and effectively**

This meeting is designed to equip youth and adults with the most common construction skills they will use on a Group Mission Trip—all in a safe, fun, and supportive environment. Many participants have never used basic tools before, so tonight is about learning *and* building confidence.

It’s also an awesome way to involve adult volunteers in your youth ministry through mentorship and practical teaching.

### **BEFORE THE MEETING:**

* Recruit adult volunteers who are skilled and able to be trainers in the following areas:
  1. Ladders
  2. Hand Tools
  3. Caulking / Utility Knives
  4. Painting
  5. Power Tools
  6. Tape Measures / Chalk Lines / Levels
* Find veteran participants, who are over 18 and very knowledgeable about tools and equipment, to be assistant trainers to help people with hands-on practice time.
* Instruct trainers and assistants that stations should be a combination of verbal instruction and hands-on training. Everyone should practice what they are learning, so make sure there is plenty of time and space for practicing.
* Don’t forget to give adult trainers the safety tip that must be reinforced in their particular section.
* It’s best to have a pre-meeting “meeting” with all trainers so everyone knows the schedule, what’s expected, and they have a chance to ask any questions.
* Set up stations according to the sections below, and have materials available at each station, as listed.
* Prior to the meeting, divide your group into six small groups that can rotate through the stations. If your group is smaller, keep everyone together. Or, if your group is on the larger side, you may need to create larger stations or multiple smaller stations so that everyone can have practice time.
* If you didn’t already hand out the **Tool List** from your customer account, be sure to print and make copies of it to distribute at this meeting.
* See the painting section of this meeting for a document called “Just Painting”. Figure out a way to review the points of this document in this meeting. You could work it into the painting station or discuss it when you are going through your group’s tools towards the end of the meeting.

### **WELCOME**

* Open with prayer and then explain how the meeting will work.
* Announce the six small groups that will rotate through the stations and introduce the adult trainers and assistant trainers.
* Say something like*\: This meeting is all about home repair skills safety and training. After 15 minutes at your first station, I’ll call for you to rotate. Move quickly to the next station, and make sure everyone has a chance to practice the skills at that station. We have an hour and a half for this training. Before we get started, I’d like you to repeat after me a very important phrase: “My safety is my number one job.” (Have everyone repeat it.) We’ll repeat that phrase when we get to each new station. Go!*

### **STATION 1: LADDERS**

At this station, participants will gain confidence and hands-on experience using ladders safely and effectively—an essential skill on any mission trip worksite. Trainers should demonstrate each concept, then allow participants time for practice with supervision and encouragement.

Supplies Needed: Stepladders and extension ladders<br>Participants should learn:

• **Ladder Types & Uses:** How to identify the difference between a stepladder and an extension ladder, and when each should be used on a worksite.<br>• **Safe Setup Techniques:** How to properly raise, extend, and secure an extension ladder, and how to lock a stepladder in place before climbing.<br>• **Correct Ladder Angle:** The safe ladder angle rule—place the ladder **1 foot away from the base for every 4 feet of height** to ensure stability.<br>• **Roof Access Safety:** Any ladder used to access a roof **must extend at least 3 feet above the landing point** for safe entry and exit.<br>• **Proper Climbing Form:** Always face the ladder, maintain three points of contact (two feet and one hand or two hands and one foot), and climb slowly and intentionally.<br>• **Spotting and Team Support:** Why it’s critical to have another person hold and stabilize the ladder while someone is climbing—safety is a team effort!<br>• **Moving and Transporting Ladders:** How to safely carry and reposition ladders to avoid hitting people, property, or power lines.

SAFETY TIP: When you’re up on a ladder, look out for overhead power lines. They carry enough electricity to kill instantly. Never, under any circumstances, touch an overhead electric line or electrical service entrance. Let’s say our favorite safety phrase all together: My safety is my number one job!

### **STATION 2: HAND TOOLS**

At this station, participants will gain confidence using essential hand tools they’ll be working with throughout the mission trip. Each tool will be introduced with a demonstration followed by hands-on practice to build muscle memory and safe habits.

Supplies Needed: Phillips screwdrivers, slotted screwdrivers, chisels, hammers, nail bars, many 16d nails, and scrap lumber to drive and remove nails

Participants should learn the safe and proper use of a:

• **Phillips Screwdriver**: Identify the cross-shaped tip, align it correctly in the screw head, apply firm pressure, and turn with control to avoid stripping the screw or slipping.

• **Slotted (Flathead) Screwdriver**: Understand its single flat blade, proper alignment, and technique to prevent the tool from slipping out and causing injury.

• **Chisel**: Learn how to hold and guide the chisel at the correct angle, and how to safely strike it with a hammer when shaping or removing wood. Discuss when to use a chisel versus another tool.

• **Hammer**: Practice gripping the hammer correctly near the end of the handle for leverage, swinging with control (not force), and driving nails smoothly. Learn how to remove nails safely using the hammer’s claw.

• **Nail Bar**: Understand different ends of the bar, how to position it under a nail head, and use leverage (not brute force) to remove nails without damaging surrounding materials.

&nbsp;

SAFETY TIP: Don’t use a tool for a task for which it was not intended. Generally speaking, if you’re forcing the tool, you’re probably not using it correctly, and you’re more likely to get hurt. Let’s say our favorite safety phrase altogether: My safety is my number one job!

### **STATION 3: CAULKING, UTILITY KNIFE**

This station teaches participants how to properly seal gaps and cracks—an essential skill for weatherproofing and improving energy efficiency in homes. Participants will also learn to safely handle utility knives, one of the most commonly used (and potentially dangerous) tools on the worksite.

Supplies Needed: caulking guns, tubes of caulk, scrap lumber to practice squeezing and smoothing caulk on, rags for wiping up, utility knives with blades, nails for corking the opened caulk tubes

Participants should learn:

• **What Caulk Is and Why It's Used**: Understand how caulk prevents air and moisture from entering a house. Participants will learn where caulk is commonly applied—around windows, doors, trim, and cracks in siding—to protect homes from the elements.

• **How to Load and Operate a Caulking Gun**: Step-by-step practice loading the tube, cutting the tip at a proper angle, puncturing the seal, and applying steady pressure to dispense caulk smoothly.

• **How to Open and Prepare a Tube of Caulk**: Learn how to correctly cut the nozzle and pierce the inner seal using the tool on the caulk gun or a nail—without damaging the tube or causing excess caulk to spill.

• **How to Apply and Smooth Caulk**: Practice creating a consistent bead of caulk and smoothing it with a finger (or a caulking tool) to seal the gap completely. Emphasize using light pressure and wiping excess to maintain a clean finish.

• **How to Remove and Store Caulk Properly**: Learn how to unload the caulk tube, seal it with a nail or tape to prevent drying out and store it upright for future use.

• **Utility Knife Safety and Operation**: Understand how to grip and cut safely, change blades when dull, and always cut away from your body. Participants will practice scoring or trimming materials with control and precision.

SAFETY TIP: Immediately retract the blade of a utility knife after each use—even if you’re just setting it down for a minute. Let’s say our favorite safety phrase altogether: My safety is my number one job!

### **STATION 4: PAINTING**

This station trains participants in one of the most common and visible elements of mission work—painting homes with care and excellence. Participants will learn proper painting techniques, surface preparation, and cleanup procedures to ensure durability and a professional finish.

Supplies Needed: cans of house paint, wooden stirrers, various paintbrushes, paint trays, paint rollers and paint roller covers, scrapers, scrap lumber to practice painting on, a hose for cleaning, dust masks, and safety goggles to demonstrate safe scraping

Participants should learn how to:

• **Open and Stir Paint Properly**: Learn how to remove a paint lid safely and use a stir stick to mix paint thoroughly, ensuring color consistency and an even finish.

• **Use a Paintbrush Effectively**: Understand how to dip a brush properly, remove excess paint, apply smooth strokes, and cut in around edges, windows, and trim.

• **Pour Paint into a Tray Without Spilling**: Practice controlled pouring techniques and learn how much paint is needed in the tray for rolling.

• **Connect a Roller Cover to a Paint Roller**: Participants will learn how to securely attach the roller cover and check that it spins smoothly to ensure even application.

• **Use a Paint Roller**: Learn how to load a roller with paint, apply using the “W” or “M” technique for even coverage, and avoid dripping or over-rolling.

• **Prepare Surfaces for Painting (Including Scraping)**: Understand the importance of removing loose paint, sanding rough edges, and cleaning surfaces before painting to ensure better adhesion. Demonstrate scraping techniques using safety goggles and dust masks.

• **Close a Paint Can for Future Use**: Learn how to wipe the rim clean and tap the lid securely without deforming the can, preserving paint for later.

• **Clean Brushes, Rollers, and Trays**: Practice rinsing tools immediately, using proper technique to prevent paint from drying in bristles or roller covers, extending the life of the equipment.

SAFETY TIP: In any home repair scenario, assume the old paint on the house is lead-based, and wear dust masks when scraping. Inhaling paint dust is a serious health hazard. Let’s say our favorite safety phrase altogether: My safety is my number one job!

##### **Youth Leaders, please share! “JUST PAINTING” – The Power of a Paintbrush**

Sometimes we hear participants say they’re “just painting,” as if painting is a small or insignificant task. But the truth is: **painting is one of the most meaningful and life-changing projects you can do on a mission trip**—for both the resident and you.

##### **Why Painting Matters So Much**

**1\. Paint Protects Homes and Preserves Lives**

Paint isn’t just about appearance—it’s a critical protective layer that shields a home from weather, moisture, and decay.

* A Group Mission Trips developer once revisited homes in a low-income community that youth groups had painted years earlier. Housing experts were astonished to see that those painted homes were **still structurally sound**, despite harsh weather conditions.
* Meanwhile, a nearby unpainted home had siding that had rotted through, insulation destroyed by moisture, and wall studs compromised—all because it lacked a protective coat of paint. The home was beyond repair… and it all could have been prevented with something as simple and affordable as paint.

**A coat of paint can literally save a house from destruction.**

**2\. Paint Restores Dignity and Hope**

For many of the residents we serve, a fresh coat of paint isn’t cosmetic—it’s transformational.

* One mission partner in the poorest county in the U.S. insisted that **every home receive a new coat of paint**, no matter what other repairs were needed. Why? Because for residents who feel forgotten, a freshly painted home signals value, renewal, and worth.
* He shared the story of two children who refused to ride the school bus because they were embarrassed by their home’s appearance. After their house was painted, those children proudly boarded the bus again. What changed? Their home—and their self-esteem.

**Paint doesn’t just improve a house. It uplifts the heart.**

##### **More Than a Project—It’s a Ministry**

When residents get to choose a paint color months in advance, their eyes light up with excitement and pride. They’re not just picking a color; they’re choosing **hope, dignity, and a fresh start**.

So, the next time someone says, “We’re just painting,” remember:

**You’re not just painting a house—you’re preserving a home and restoring a person’s sense of worth.**

A paintbrush in your hand is a tool God can use to change lives.

### **STATION 5: POWER TOOLS**

Power tools make projects faster and more efficient—but they also require focus, responsibility, and a serious commitment to safety. This station teaches participants not just how to use power tools, but how to respect them.

Supplies Needed: power saw, power drill, spare blades, spare bits, screw tip bits, extension cord, power source, safety goggles, sawhorses, scrap lumber to practice cutting and drilling, screws for drilling.

Note: Any participant may use a power drill/driver to insert screws into boards. However, participants under age 16 are **not permitted** to operate any power tools. Those under age 18 are **not allowed** to use a power saw at Group Mission Trips. These rules ensure safety and compliance with insurance and liability guidelines.

Participants should learn how to:

· **Safely and properly use a power saw and drill:** Learn how to handle power tools with control and precision, including how to start, operate, and shut them down properly. They will practice cutting and drilling using scrap lumber to gain confidence under supervision.

· **Use eye protection:** Eye protection is mandatory at all times when operating or standing near active power tools to protect from dust, debris, or accidental material kickback.

· **Change blades and bits and know when those changes are necessary:** Learn how to identify dull or damaged blades and bits, understand how they affect performance, and practice how to safely change them using the proper tools and procedures.

· **Properly use extension cords:** Instruction will include selecting the appropriate gauge cord, inspecting cords for damage, keeping them away from cutting paths, and ensuring cords are fully plugged into a grounded power source.

SAFETY TIP: Be careful not to use power tools in wet conditions. Always unplug power tools immediately after each use. Also, power tools must be used under the supervision of an adult at all times during the mission trip. Let’s say our favorite safety phrase altogether: My safety is my number one job!

### **STATION 6: TAPE MEASURES/CHALK LINES/LEVELS**

This station provides the foundational skills needed for accurate building and repair work. Proper measuring and leveling ensure that every project is done correctly, safely, and professionally.

Supplies Needed: tape measures, chalk lines, levels, various objects to measure and check the level, speed square (optional), T-square (optional)

Participants should learn how to:

· **Read a tape measure**: Practice identifying whole inches, half inches, quarter inches, and smaller fractions to accurately measure materials needed for construction.

· **Mark a board for cutting**: Learn to transfer measurements onto materials and make clear, precise marks to ensure accurate cuts.

· **Lock the tape measure**: Instruction will cover how to lock the tape measure in place to prevent slipping and ensure exact measurements.

· **Identify the various fractions of an inch on a tape measure**: Learn how to read detailed increments, a crucial skill for fitting materials properly.

· **Purposefully and properly use a chalk line**: Learn how to snap a straight line over a long distance to guide cuts or positioning on work surfaces.

· **Use a level both vertically and horizontally**: Practice placing a level to check if surfaces are perfectly straight, flat, plumb, or square to ensure structures are safe and accurate.

· **Advanced Skill (Optional): Use a speed square and T-square**: Students ready for advanced instruction can be introduced to these tools to quickly mark angles, create square cuts, and ensure accuracy in layout work.

SAFETY TIP: Keep small tools in a central location or on your tool belt. Return them after each use. If you spend less time searching for tools, you’ll have less opportunity to get hurt! Let’s say our favorite safety phrase altogether: My safety is my number one job!

### **WRAP UP & TOOLS:**

* After everyone has gone through all the stations, gather back together. Have the trainers available after the meeting to answer any additional questions about the skills they learned.
* Say something like: When on your work site, do not do anything if it feels unsafe. The work you’ll be doing is very important, and it’s an expression of our love for Jesus, but no task should be done in an unsafe manner.
* Say: If you forget safety and get hurt, you won’t be able to keep serving people. So, let’s say our favorite safety phrase all together one more time: “My safety is my number one job.” Good job!
* Pass out the Tool List, if needed. Say something like: The tools we have been asked to bring will help us accomplish just about any task we’re asked to do this summer.
* Review how your group is doing on assembling tools. If they haven’t already, ask participants to look for items in their garage or borrow them before purchasing something brand new. (Some places may be willing to donate tools, so don’t forget to ask!) Also, remind them to put their names on their tools so they get them back. Let them know where they need to bring their tools and when.
* Pay special attention to the ladders listed. Ladders are often in short supply at the mission trip, so plan to bring plenty of step and extension ladders. Have the owners write their names clearly on their ladders and put your church’s name on them as well. Ladders are checked into a tool room upon arrival at the lodging facility, and various crews throughout the week will use them. You will need to pick them up on the last night of the mission trip to take them home.
* If you haven’t done so already, review the points of the “Just Painting” document.
* Have everyone give the trainers a big round of applause, and close in prayer.

### **BONUS PRACTICE:**

For real, hands-on practice–coordinate a real construction project. Perhaps someone in your church or community needs a new coat of paint or a wheelchair ramp on their home, consider providing this for them. Or perhaps use it as a fundraiser for the trip.
