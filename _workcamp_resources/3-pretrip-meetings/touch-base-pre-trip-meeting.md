This short, energizing check-in helps keep excitement high and everyone on track for your upcoming mission trip!

Because it’s designed to be quick, you can easily combine it with a bigger event—like a fundraiser or the serving event that is part of “Pre-Trip Meeting \#2. (If you choose that, check the detailed guide—it takes a bit more prep but adds a powerful experience.)

---

### **Before the Meeting**

* Have your Group Mission Trips customer account open to help answer any questions.
* If you’re going to organize a serving event, be ready to share the date, time, and location.
* Consider playing the Youth Expectations Video to help your group refocus on what the trip experience will be like this summer.

---

### **Welcome**

**Say** something like:

“Hey everyone! Thanks for coming. This is just a quick touch-base to make sure we’re all set for our mission trip to \[Destination\] this summer. We’ll be heading out \[Dates\], so mark your calendars and make it a priority—people are counting on us, and this trip will be amazing. Let’s get ready to serve, grow, and make a difference together!”

---

### **Fundraising Update**

Give a brief update on your group’s financial progress:

* What fundraisers have you completed so far?
* What events or opportunities are coming up next?
* Celebrate the wins and encourage continued momentum.

“We’re doing great—thank you for all the effort so far! Every dollar raised helps us serve more fully and focus on what matters most.”

---

### **Your Customer Account**

Remind everyone of helpful online resources:

* Personal “Illuminate” Devotions – Available this spring! These are great for preparing hearts for service and reflection before the trip.
* Song List – Share it now so your group can start listening and learning the songs that will set the tone for worship at camp.

---

### **Updates**

* Announce any changes to the itinerary or participant list.
* Give updates on Community Gift donations or other group goals.
* Make sure everyone knows about important deadlines or upcoming meetings.

---

### **Serving Project Plan**

If you’re planning a serving event, explain it briefly:

* It’s a practice day of service where crews work together to meet a real need in your local community.
* Discuss logistics (who, when, and where).
* Emphasize the fun, teamwork, and spiritual preparation it provides before the actual trip.

---

### **Closing**

* Open the floor for questions.
* Remind everyone of the date and time for your next meeting.
* Close with a short prayer, such as:

“God, thank you for the opportunity to serve you this summer. Help us stay excited, prepared, and united as a team. Fill our hearts with love for the people we’ll meet and the work you’ve called us to do. Amen.”

### **Quick Tip**

If you have a few extra minutes, end with a short team-building moment—like sharing what each person is most looking forward to about the trip. It keeps the energy high and helps everyone feel connected.
