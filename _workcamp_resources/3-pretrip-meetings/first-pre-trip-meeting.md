**Say:** Welcome to our Mission Trip Meeting! We are heading to **(your mission trip location)** this summer during **(your dates)**. This experience is going to be life-changing—full of adventure, meaningful relationships, powerful moments with Jesus, and the opportunity to serve people in real need. You’re going to make memories that last a lifetime and friendships that go far beyond this trip!

Before we dive into details, let’s get a visual of what this trip is all about.

**(Play the Group Mission Trips promo video or the Youth Expectations video.)**

**Optional**: Invite a couple of students or adults who have been on past mission trips to briefly share one highlight from their experience.

### **Icebreaker Game: “Mission Match-Up!”**

##### **Instructions:**

* Hand everyone a card as they walk in. **(All the cards are at the bottom of this meeting.)** Half the cards have a service-related situation (like “Painting a house in 95-degree weather”) and the other half have a matching positive outcome (like “The homeowner shares how this changes their life”).
* When you say, “Go Serve!”, everyone walks around to find their matching partner.
* Once matched, each pair introduces themselves and shares one reason they’re excited for the trip.
* Have 2 or 3 pairs read their card combo to the group to highlight both the challenge *and* the reward of serving.

**Say:** Just like in this game, this trip will bring challenges and incredible moments of impact. We’re going to experience both—and that’s what makes mission trips so powerful!

### **Inviting Others**

**Say:** This mission trip isn’t just for us—it’s an amazing opportunity to get your friends involved in something meaningful. Grab one of the flyers and think of one person you can personally invite. You never know whose life might change because you invited them to serve!

1. Pass out ONE card to each person.
2. Have everyone stand up and yell “GO SERVE!” to begin.
3. Participants mix and mingle to find their matching pair (Challenge + Impact).

For larger groups, you can have everyone stand in a circle and have pairs step forward one at a time to “tell the story” of their match.
