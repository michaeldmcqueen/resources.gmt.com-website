### Dietary Restrictions & Food Allergies

We know that every participant’s health matters. Our goal is to work together to keep everyone safe and well-fed.

If a participant has a food allergy or restriction:

· Trip leaders should review this Sample Menu with participants so they can plan supplemental meals or snacks.

· Contact Group Mission Trips before camp for gluten-free or other dietary needs.

· No registration discount applies for bringing personal food, but storage space will be provided.

Severe allergies: Notify Group Mission Trips in advance. Make a note in your customer account under Special Notes for special requests. Participants may be paired with someone from their group who understands their needs. Bring necessary medication (like an EpiPen) and consider a small personal cooler.
