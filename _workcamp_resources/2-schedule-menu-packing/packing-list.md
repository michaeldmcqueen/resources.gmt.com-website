### **Cell Phones, iPods, Laptops, etc.**

For security reasons, it’s best to leave these items at home.<br>We get it—they’re great for capturing memories and keeping in touch—but **don’t let them distract you** from the people and purpose around you.

“How can you be tethered to your devices and expect God to work in unexpected ways?”

If you do bring them, please keep them put away during programs (unless it’s part of the program experience) and on work sites.
