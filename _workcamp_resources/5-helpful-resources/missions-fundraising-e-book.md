### **Rethinking Generosity: What Happens When Giving Gets Personal**

Think about the last time someone invited you to give—maybe not just money, but time, resources, or support. It could’ve come through a GoFundMe link, a social media post from a friend in need, a church announcement, or even a quick Venmo request from someone raising funds for a cause.

Some invitations feel easy to respond to. The mission is clear. The need is urgent. Your heart is moved. Other times, you pause. Thoughts race through your mind: *Can I afford this? Will my gift even make a difference? Why are they asking me?*

What you feel in those moments is important—not because it reveals your bank balance, but because it reveals your heart posture.

### **The Real Question**

When an opportunity to give presents itself, are you more likely to lean in—or pull back? This isn’t just about generosity—it’s about trust. Do you see your resources as something to protect…or something God has given you to release when he prompts?

### **Two Truths to Keep in Mind**

* **Your past responses don’t define your future generosity.** Maybe in a previous season you were cautious or overwhelmed. That doesn’t have to be your story going forward. God grows us over time.
* **Everyone experiences giving differently.** Some people give quickly. Others take time to process. Some feel joy when giving; others feel anxiety. That’s normal—and it’s the same range of emotions people will experience when *you* invite them to partner with what God is calling you to do.

### **Why This Matters for Fundraising**

When you step into fundraising, you’re not just asking people for money—you’re stepping into a spiritual moment. The tension you may feel when someone asks you to give? Others will feel that too. Your goal isn’t to pressure—it’s to invite. To share vision. To help people recognize where their resources can be used for Kingdom impact.

### **The Heart Check**

The next time you’re faced with a giving opportunity—whether it’s for your church, a mission trip, or a need in your community—pause and ask:

* *Am I responding out of fear or faith?*
* *Do I see this as losing something or participating in something God is doing?*
* *Am I listening to my own inner voice—or the voice of the Holy Spirit?*

**How you view giving will shape how you ask others to give.** When you understand the spiritual weight of generosity, fundraising stops feeling like asking for money and begins to feel like extending an invitation to be part of God’s work.

### **Fundraising Is Not Just Financial—It’s Spiritual**

Fundraising often gets reduced to dollars, goals, and deadlines—but at its core, fundraising is a spiritual practice. It invites people to participate in what God is doing. It shifts our focus from simply collecting money to cultivating faith, obedience, and partnership in God's mission.

##### **1\. Fundraising Aligns Our Hearts with God’s Mission**

When we invite others to give, we are not asking them to fund *our* plans—we are inviting them to join *God’s* work. Fundraising requires us to seek God’s direction, to depend on His provision, and to stay rooted in the belief that he is the source—not our efforts or strategies.

**Fundraising isn’t about making something happen—it's about watching what God will do through His people.**

##### **2\. Fundraising Builds Trust Over Control**

Asking for support requires humility. It places us in a posture of dependence rather than self-sufficiency. In Scripture, God repeatedly uses financial dependence to shape His people’s faith. Fundraising reminds us that *we are participants in God’s provision, not the providers ourselves.*

##### **3\. Fundraising Invites Others into Spiritual Growth**

Giving is an act of worship. When you ask someone to give, you are not burdening them—you are offering them an opportunity to respond to God’s call with generosity and obedience. Many people *want* to be part of something meaningful; fundraising gives them a pathway to do so.

People don’t just give to support you—they give as a response to what God is stirring in their own hearts.

##### **4\. Fundraising Reveals the Condition of Our Hearts**

Jesus said, “Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (Matthew 6:21). Fundraising isn’t primarily concerned with wallets—it reveals where our hearts are anchored. It teaches us to release our grip, to surrender our preferences, and to experience the joy of partnering with God.

&nbsp;

#####

##### **5\. Fundraising Becomes a Testimony of God’s Faithfulness**

Every dollar raised is a story—not of what *we* accomplished, but of how God moved through His people. Fundraising done prayerfully becomes a record of God showing up, often through completely unexpected people at just the right time.

---

**The bottom line?** Fundraising is not a transactional activity. It is a spiritual invitation—for you and for those who choose to give. It deepens trust, builds community, and declares that we believe God’s mission is worth investing in—not just with our words, but with our resources.

### **Prayer for Fundraising**

*Lord, everything we have comes from You. You are the source of all provision, inspiration, and generosity. As we step into this season of fundraising, help us to trust not in our efforts, but in Your faithfulness. Open our hearts and the hearts of those we invite to give—not out of pressure, but out of joy and partnership in Your mission. Use every conversation, every gift, and even every moment of uncertainty to draw us closer to You. May this process not just raise money but raise faith. In Jesus’ name, Amen.*

---

### **Reflection**

Take a moment to ask yourself:

* *Am I approaching fundraising as a spiritual partnership or just a financial task?*
* *Where might God be inviting me to trust him more deeply through this process?*
* *How is God using fundraising to shape my heart, my faith, and my dependence on him?*

*Fundraising is not something we do to “get money”—it’s something God uses to build his Kingdom and transform hearts, starting with our own.*

<br>

### **Church Fundraising 101: Inviting People into God’s Mission**

Money was one of Jesus’ most frequent teaching tools—not because he was after people’s wallets, but because he was after their hearts. Fundraising in the church isn’t about pressure or obligation; it’s about vision, transformation, and spiritual partnership. When done well, fundraising becomes a community rallying around a God-sized mission.

To lead with purpose, form a small fundraising team—people who believe in the vision and are willing to help make it visible to others. This not only multiplies your impact, it allows you, as a leader, to stay focused on spiritual direction and relationship-building.

### **Key Steps for Successful, Spirit-Led Fundraising**

##### **1\. Clarify Your Vision**

Gather your leaders and ask: *Why does our church or group exist? Why are we going on this mission?* Be able to summarize this in two or three sentences. A clear vision makes fundraising about purpose—not money.

##### **2\. Create a Vision Portfolio**

Build a simple one-page overview that explains:

* Your mission and goals
* Why this trip matters spiritually
* How lives have been changed through past experiences<br>Add photos, testimonies, and personal stories. People give to vision and impact—not just events.

##### **3\. Build a Strategic Calendar**

Plan a series of fundraising efforts before and after your trip. Choose events that align with your church’s culture and passions. For each event, ask:

* *Does this support spiritual growth?*
* *Does this excite our people?*
* *Will this build momentum or drain energy?*

##### **4\. Identify Barriers Early**

Don’t ignore reality. Are there existing debts from past trips? Is your community facing economic hardship? If so, consider expanding your reach by fundraising online, connecting with alumni, or inviting outside partners who care about missions.

##### **5\. Make Needs Visible**

List exactly what your group needs—transportation, supplies, meals, scholarships, etc. Share this with the congregation so people can donate items, sponsor specific costs, or connect you with resources you wouldn’t otherwise find.

##### **6\. Provide Simple Ways to Give**

Remove obstacles by creating easy giving avenues:

* Pre-addressed, postage-paid envelopes
* Online giving through your church’s website
* Mobile or text-to-give options
* Donation kiosks or card readers at events

People are far more likely to give when the process is simple and accessible.

##### **7\. Express Gratitude Immediately**

Thank each donor personally and specifically—acknowledge their faithfulness and affirm how their generosity is part of God’s work. Gratitude nurtures ongoing partnership.

##### **8\. Follow Up with Celebration**

After the trip, invite your donors to a celebration night or special service. Let them hear firsthand how their giving made an impact. This transforms donors into long-term partners in ministry.

---

### **Remember: Fundraising Is Ministry**

This isn’t about asking for money—it’s about offering people the opportunity to invest in eternal impact. You’re not fundraising *from* them—you’re fundraising *for* them, by giving them the chance to engage in God’s mission in a meaningful way.

### **Final Thoughts**

##### **Fundraising With Vision, Not Pressure**

Fundraising for a mission trip should never be reduced to simply asking people for money. Instead, think of it as inviting others into what God is already doing. When you clearly communicate God’s calling on your life and how he is moving through this mission, people are far more likely to respond with joy and partnership—not out of guilt, but out of purpose.

##### **Lead With Vision**

People don’t just want to give *to you*—they want to give *with you* toward something that matters. Share the mission God has placed in front of you, explain why you’re stepping out in faith, and show them how their support can be part of that story. Prayer, passion, and persistence matter far more than perfect strategies.

---

### **Wise Steps to Building Support**

##### **1\. Make a Prayerful List**

Think about the people God has placed in different seasons of your life—church members, family friends, teachers, coaches, co-workers, past mentors. These are people who have already invested in you spiritually or personally and may be eager to support your calling.

##### **2\. Prioritize Relationships**

Prayerfully identify your top 10 people to contact first—those you sense God nudging you toward. Then create groups of 10 to follow. Trust that God will guide your conversations and provide through the relationships he has already placed in your life.

##### **3\. Share the Story**

Write a one-page letter or email that clearly communicates:

* What God has called you to do
* How this mission will impact lives
* What your financial goal is and by when
* A suggested giving range or ways to support

Include a link to the mission organization so people understand the credibility and purpose behind the trip.

##### **4\. Be Bold in Asking**

Decide who should receive your letter and who you should meet with in person. Don’t shy away from asking. You’re not asking *for yourself*—you’re asking *on behalf of the mission God has called you to*. Never say “no” for someone before they’ve even had the opportunity to respond.

##### **5\. Keep Your Supporters Connected**

Create an email list, blog, or simple newsletter before the trip begins. Send updates as you prepare, share prayer needs, and then send photos and stories during and after the trip. This transforms donors into partners who celebrate the fruit of their investment.

---

### **Trust God in the Process**

Some people raise funds quickly; others walk through a slow and stretching journey. Both paths are spiritual. God may choose to build your faith through miraculous provision—or through hard work and perseverance. Either way, he is faithful. You are not begging for money—you are stepping into partnership with God’s people to advance God’s mission.

**If God has called you, he will make a way. Financial limitations cannot stop a God-ordained mission.**

---

### **Your Role: Communicate, Work, and Believe**

* Choose fundraisers that are easy to explain and exciting to support.
* Use the personality God gave you—whether relational or administrative—to maximize your strengths.
* Be organized, stay prayerful, and communicate clearly.

**Whatever it takes, trust God to provide. Your responsibility is to step out in faith—his promise is to supply what is needed. This is not just fundraising—it’s discipleship, community-building, and faith in action.**
