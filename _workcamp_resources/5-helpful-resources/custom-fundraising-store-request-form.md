We’re excited to partner with our t-shirt vendor and create a personalized online store for your group with some default clothing items, accessories, and designs. You can then promote this store to your friends, family, and church for some cool purchasable merch they can wear to support your group. Everything is taken care of, and once we get your store up and running, you can start fundraising immediately.

[**SUBMIT REQUEST FORM &gt;**](https://form.jotform.com/topshelfprinters2010/form){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"}

Here’s how it works:

* Click the “[SUBMIT REQUEST FORM &gt;](https://form.jotform.com/topshelfprinters2010/form "Custom Online Fundraising Store Request Form"){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"}” link and fill out some information about your group/church and we’ll start working on personalizing and setting up your store.
* Once your store is set up, you will receive an email containing a link to your fundraising store and login information to access the platform and start fundraising!
* All purchases, payments, and shipping are taken care of, so you don’t need to do anything if you don’t want to; easy peasy. A default markup will be added per item, ensuring every sale contributes directly to your group.
* Because you will have full access to manage the online platform, you can also update prices, change colors, or request custom designs!
* Once sales start rolling in, you’ll receive payments from your sales directly from our partner as orders are completed and fulfilled. More info about payout options and frequency is explained during the set up process.
