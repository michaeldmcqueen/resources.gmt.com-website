<div><p>The idea of serving is a central part of any mission trip. Everyone knows they are going to serve when they decide to go. But why serve? What is it about serving that is appealing – so dynamic? We experience pressures in our lives. Pressures that push and pull us toward focusing on ourselves instead of others. Serving changes our focus from the internal to the external. We have a chance to get outside of ourselves and reorient our lives around others and around God.</p></div>
