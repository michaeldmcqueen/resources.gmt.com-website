### **Theme: Equipped**

We will use the acronym EQUIP. This will be an acronym your students can take home with them to quickly remember what's in their toolbox whenever they are faced with a challenge.

**E – Evaluate**

**Q – Question**

**U – Understand**

**I – Improve**

**P – Proclaim**

&nbsp;

We will explore EQUIP through the eyes of Saul who becomes Paul. We will look at his transformation. The decisions he had to make. And how Jesus pursued Saul.

**E – Evaluate**

**Key Concept:**

When we encounter conflict, stress, a difficult decision, or even a very exciting opportunity we can utilize our toolbox. Our first step is to evaluate the situation. This allows us to take a moment to understand our situation before moving forward.

**SCRIPTURE: Acts 9:1-4**

*Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s disciples. He went to the high priest <sup>2</sup> and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any there who belonged to the Way, whether men or women, he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem.*

*<sup>3</sup> As he neared Damascus on his journey, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. <sup>4</sup> He fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”*

**Q – Question**

**Key Concept:**

**Jesus welcomes our questions and understands that sometimes we may be frustrated or angry with Him. Jesus will always love us through those moments of disappointment and frustration. Jesus also provides us with communities that we can lean on. Our community is a powerful tool that can help us talk through our disappointments and help us find peace and understanding again.**

**SCRIPTURE – Acts 9: 5-9**

*<sup>5</sup> “Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked.*

*“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” he replied. <sup>6</sup> “Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.”*

*<sup>7</sup> The men traveling with Saul stood there speechless; they heard the sound but did not see anyone. <sup>8</sup> Saul got up from the ground, but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing. So they led him by the hand into Damascus. <sup>9</sup> For three days he was blind, and did not eat or drink anything.*

**U – Understand**

**Key Concept:**

We do not always understand God’s plan for us. Sometimes what we are asked to do or what is happening in our lives does not make sense to us. However, His plan is always better than our own and he can help us understand.

**SCRIPTURE – Acts 9: 10-17**

*<sup>10</sup> In Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord called to him in a vision, “Ananias!”*

&nbsp;

*“Yes, Lord,” he answered.*

&nbsp;

*<sup>11</sup> The Lord told him, “Go to the house of Judas on Straight Street and ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul, for he is praying. <sup>12</sup> In a vision he has seen a man named Ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight.”*

&nbsp;

*<sup>13</sup> “Lord,”* [*Ananias*]() *answered, “I have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your holy people in Jerusalem. <sup>14</sup> And he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.”*

&nbsp;

*<sup>15</sup> But the Lord said to Ananias, “Go! This man is my chosen instrument to proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel. <sup>16</sup> I will show him how much he must suffer for my name.”*

&nbsp;

*<sup>17</sup> Then Ananias went to the house and entered it. Placing his hands on Saul, he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord—Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here—has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.*

**I – Improve**

**Key Concept:**

We have to make the active decision to follow Christ, love others well, and live a holy life every day. More often than not we won’t feel 100% confident or ready for the decisions we make but we should trust in God. Jesus made the decision to die for us even though he knew how hard it would be.

**SCRIPTURE 2 – Acts 9 18-19a**

*<sup>18</sup> Immediately, something like scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,<sup>19</sup>and after taking some food, he regained his strength.*

**P – Proclaim**

**Key Concept:**

Jesus walks with us through every high and low of life. Through the good times and the hard times, we are meant to live a life that glorifies Jesus. We are meant to spread Jesus’ Word and love all his people.

**SCRIPTURE – Acts 9:19b – 22**

*Saul spent several days with the disciples in Damascus. <sup>20</sup> At once he began to preach in the synagogues that Jesus is the Son of God. <sup>21</sup> All those who heard him were astonished and asked, “Isn’t he the man who raised havoc in Jerusalem among those who call on this name? And hasn’t he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests?” <sup>22</sup> Yet Saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the Jews living in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.*
