### Pre-Trip Devotion \#1

*(Note to youth leaders: These devotions are meant to be a starting-off place to help prepare your group for this year’s Group Mission Trip experience. Please feel free to adjust the material to fit your context.)*

**Ice Breaker:** Follow the light

**How to Play:**

1\. Designate 1 person as the “Light Leader”. They will need a flashlight or their phone flashlight.

2\. Shut off all of the lights and tell the rest of the students to disperse around the room.

3\. The Light Leader will stand in 1 spot and slowly shine the light all across the room, moving it around slowly and steadily, pausing every once in a while.

4\. The rest of the students must follow the light wherever it goes.

5\. Do this for a couple of minutes. If desired, switch out the Light Leader to try it with a few different people.

**Ask and Discuss:**

\- What was easy about following the light?

\- What was hard about following the light?

\- Did you ever hesitate to follow where the light was leading?

God invites us to step toward his light. We may not know everything that lays ahead, but we *can* trust who is leading. In the game, following the light wasn’t about speed or winning—it was about awareness. It required paying attention, letting go of control, and trusting that wherever the light moved was the path we were meant to follow. This is exactly how God asks us to approach him. His light isn’t something we create, it’s something we follow and step into. It is steady, faithful, and always pointing us in the right direction.

Our week at camp will be a special opportunity to practice noticing his light, following it closely, and allowing him to reveal things we couldn’t see on our own. Some of the things God reveals might be exciting—new friendships, fun experiences, or ways he speaks to your heart. Other things might feel uncomfortable—moments where he challenges fears, exposes habits, or calls us to grow in ways we didn’t expect. But just as in the game, we don’t have to know the whole path ahead. We only need to keep our eyes on the Light, trust the One who holds it, and take the next step, even when it’s uncertain.

**Scripture:** John 8:12 – Jesus says, *“I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”*

**Ask and Discuss:**

\- What does this scripture tell us about God?

\- What does this scripture tell us about ourselves?

\- Why is it sometimes hard to take a step towards God’s light if we don’t know what’s ahead?

\- How can we encourage each other to take those next steps, even when it feels uncertain?

**Closing Thought:** Jesus is the true Light of the world. John 8:12 tells us that when we follow him, we will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. This means that no matter what fears, doubts, or confusion we face, his light is greater and cannot be overcome. Following Jesus doesn’t mean life will always be easy or that we will understand every step of the path, but it does mean that we have a guide we can trust. His light brings hope, direction, and clarity when everything around us feels uncertain.

**Prayer:** God, Thank You for being the Light of the world. Thank You for guiding us, even when we don’t know the whole path ahead. Help us to notice Your light in our lives—to see where You are leading, even in the small or mundane moments. Teach us to trust You fully, letting go of our need to control and following You step by step. Give us courage to step into the unknown, knowing that Your light is steady, faithful, and always pointing us in the right direction. Thank You for never leaving us in darkness and for being our guide, our hope, and our Light. Amen.

### Pre-Trip Devotion \#2

**Ice Breaker:** Reveal the Picture

**Materials Needed:** 3-5 photos printed out and then cut into pieces. You can choose the photos!

**How to Play:**

1\. Take 1 piece of the image and show it to your students.

2\. Ask students to guess what it is.

3\. Gradually add more pieces to the picture until it becomes clearer.

**Ask and Discuss:**

\- How confident were you in your guess at the beginning?

\- What changed as more of the picture was revealed?

God’s light works the same way as this puzzle. He doesn’t always show us everything at once, but when his light shines, our understanding changes. Light has a way of revealing things we may not be able to see or fully understand. The moment a light shines on a dark room, we can see suddenly see what was always there. Once the light is turned on, you might see the pair of shoes you’ve been looking for, or you might see that some things are slightly out of place. Shapes become clearer, obstacles are revealed, and paths we couldn’t see before come into focus. In the same way, God’s light reveals things about *us*. When God shines His light into our lives, He helps us see ourselves, the world, and our need for Him more clearly.

**Scripture:** 2 Corinthians 4:6 For God, who said, “*Let light shine out of darkness*,” made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God’s glory displayed in the face of Christ.

**Ask and Discuss:**

\- What does this scripture tell us about God?

\- What does this scripture tell us about ourselves?

\- Does the thought of God “revealing” things in your life make you excited or anxious?

**Closing Thought:** The Bible tells us that God’s light shines in our hearts to help us know him better. This kind of light isn’t meant to shame us or overwhelm us. It’s meant to guide us, heal us, and lead us toward freedom. Sometimes God’s light reveals things we’re grateful for—strengths, growth, joy, or gratitude. Other times it reveals things that are harder to face—sin, fear, unhealthy patterns, or places we’ve been avoiding. But whatever God reveals, He does so with purpose and love. He only brings things into the light because He wants to transform them.

**Prayer:** God, thank you for being our light in the darkness. Thank You for opening our eyes to see Your truth and Your love. Thank you for revealing things in our life so that we can know you better and know ourselves better. When we face darkness—fear, doubt, or confusion—remind us that Your light is stronger, and it will show us the way. May the light of Christ in us bring hope, joy, and life to everyone around us. Amen.
