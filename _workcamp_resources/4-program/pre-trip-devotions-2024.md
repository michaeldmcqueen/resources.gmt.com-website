### Pre-Trip Devotion \#1

*(Note to youth leaders: These devotions are meant to be a starting-off place to help prepare your group for this year’s Group Mission Trip experience. Please feel free to adjust the material to fit your context.)*

###### **Supplies Needed**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

1 penny per participant

Cereal & milk (bowls and spoons) for snack

###### **Icebreaker: Penny Chinny**

Say: &nbsp;**Everybody needs to spread out – at least 3 feet apart from each other. Each person needs a penny** (hand out pennies)**.**

**This is a simple game. On my signal, balance your penny on your chin. You’ll need to look up at the ceiling and tip your head back. Once the penny is in place, you can’t touch it. You win by being the last person with your penny still balanced on your chin.**

**The strategy is to get everybody else to drop or lose their pennies, while you’re careful protecting your own.&nbsp; You can not touch other players, but you can talk to them and move around the room.**

**If you drop your penny or touch it you are immediately out of the game. However, the eliminated players can continue to play by trying to get the remaining players to drop their pennies.**

**Let’s play! Put your pennies on your chin…and go!**

*(Play until one person remains and crown them the winner!)*

###### Talk about the Game

ASK:&nbsp; **Was there something or someone that caused you to drop your penny?**

SAY:&nbsp; **During the game, you were able to influence other players by how you acted and the things you said.&nbsp; At the same time, other players tried to influence you.**&nbsp;

**Life is like that.&nbsp; There is no way to simply move through your days without being influenced by outside sources, no matter how hard you may try to maintain your focus and personal control.**&nbsp;

**It can be tricky to navigate your way through it all.&nbsp; There are positive influences out there; but there are negative influences too**.

###### Reflect

SAY:&nbsp; **You may have heard that the theme for Workcamp this summer is “Influencer.”**&nbsp;

1. **When you hear the word “influencer,” what comes to mind?**
2. &nbsp;**How would you define the word “influence?”**

###### **Discuss**

1. What or who *influenced* your decision to sign up for Workcamp?Friends? Parents? Something you learned about? Something you heard at church? You went last year and had an amazing time? Something else? Take a minute to share.
2. What are you hoping will happen while you’re at Workcamp? Make new friends? Develop new skills? Have fun? Grow spiritually? Become closer to Jesus? Have a great adventure? Something else? Take a minute to share.

###### Scripture Reading

SAY:&nbsp; **Let’s look at a passage in the Bible. Who would like to read Philippians 4:8-9?** *Wait for a volunteer and then invite all to listen to God’s Word.*

***8**&nbsp;Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.&nbsp;**9**&nbsp;Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.*



SAY:&nbsp; **In this passage, Paul encourages us to take ownership over the things that influence our thoughts. He wants us to filter the “input” – wherever it originates – so that we hold onto things that are good and healthy and Christlike.**

**That is not an easy task today. We are bombarded with words and images that aren’t always positive and beneficial for our spiritual health.**

ASK:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Which of these are sources of “input” for you on a regular basis:**

* **Video games**
* **Music**
* **Social media**
* **Gossip/talk about other people**
* **Parental feedback**
* **Books**
* **Movies**
* **TV**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**These are all sources of both *good* and *bad* influence. The trick is, use your filter. Choose wisely. Don’t just allow negative images and words to wash over you without having your guard up.**&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

**Proverbs 4:23 says this:**

23 *Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows fro*m it.&nbsp;

###### **Food for Thought**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**We’re going to share a snack now. Since we are just *beginning* our mission trip preparation, we’re going to have something lots of people eat at the *beginning* of the day: cereal.**

**As you prepare your cereal and crunch away, I want to encourage you to think about a few things this week:**

* **The input in your life. Where are you taking in words and images every day?**
* **How do you feel after spending time playing video games, listening to music, scrolling through social media?**
* **Which outside influences are positive in your life? Which are negative?**



###### **Pray**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Let’s close in prayer.**

**Loving God, thank you for the world that you created. Sometimes, we get lost in it and forget to guard our hearts. Help us to use our filters and make choices about what kinds of words and images influence our thoughts and actions. We know that you want what is best for us. Thank you for loving us. Amen.**



### Pre-Trip Devotion \#2

######

###### **Supplies Needed**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

Popcorn and candy for snack

###### **Icebreaker: Popcorn and Candy**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**We need to be sitting in a circle for our opening game.**&nbsp; *(Take time to get in a circle)*

**There are two words you need to know in order to play this game: Popcorn and Candy.**

**Here’s how the game works –**

**One person starts by saying “Popcorn” or “Candy.”**

**If they say “Popcorn” then the turn is passed to the person on the right.**

**If they say “Candy” then the turn is passed to the person on the left.**

**Whoever goes next (the person to the left or right), then says “Popcorn” or “Candy” and the turn is passed right or left, depending on which word they choose.**

**It’ll be a little confusing at first, but the idea is to increase our speed. We’ll practice for a minute…then, we’ll play for real.**

**Once we’re really playing, you’re out if you say the wrong word, go in the wrong order, or hesitate**.

**Got it? Let’s play!**

###### **Talk about the Game**&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

ASK:&nbsp; **Did you figure out a strategy for that game, or was it just confusing?**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**That game can be stressful because you have to move fast. You have to keep track of which direction is which, and which word means what.**&nbsp;**Sometimes things that are supposed to fun also create stress.**

###### **Reflect**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**When you think about Workcamp, how do you feel? Are you excited about the fun? Or are you stressed about it? Chances are, if it’s your first time going on a mission trip, you’re worried about some things. &nbsp;Even if you’ve been to Workcamp before, just getting ready to go can be a source of stress.**

###### **Discuss**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Which of the following things are you worried about when you think about Workcamp this summer?**

* **Meeting new people**
* **Having the energy and skills to do the work**
* **Missing home**
* **Being in a spiritual setting for a whole week – so much Jesus!**
* **Traveling with the group**
* **Something else?**

###### **Scripture**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Let’s look at our Bible passage. Who would like to read Matthew 6:33-34?**

***33**&nbsp;But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.&nbsp;**34**&nbsp;Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.*

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Have you ever been super worried about something and your parent or a friend tells you, “Don’t worry! It’ll be ok!”&nbsp; That isn’t always the most helpful advice. “Don’t worry” is easier said than done, right?**

**But here’s what you need to know about Workcamp:**

**It is absolutely normal to be a bit anxious about what is going to happen when you’re away from home for a week. It’s absolutely OK to look forward with a bit of worry as you anticipate meeting new friends and being challenged in new ways.**

**As it says in our passage from Matthew today, “tomorrow will worry about itself.” And that’s true. In a matter of weeks or months, you’ll be at workcamp.&nbsp; You will be serving on a crew.&nbsp; You will be challenged in new ways.&nbsp; Worrying about all of it is natural, but worrying doesn’t make things better or change the fact that you are signed up for a life-changing experience. The days will pass…and you will pack, and climb into vehicles, and pull up in front of your lodging facility. It’s just a matter of time. It will happen!**

**And…it’s going to be OK.&nbsp; God will be with you through it all. Plus, your adult leaders will have your back every step of the way.**

**And don’t forget…it’s going to be FUN.**

###### **Food for Thought**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Snack time! Inspired by our game tonight, we’re having POPCORN and CANDY!**

**As you enjoy the delicious treats, I want you to encourage you to think about a few things this week:**

* **Worry is normal. We are human, after all. We don’t know what the future holds.**
* **A great way to help you through your worries is by talking. Talk to people who have gone on mission trips before. Find out what you can so that you feel more informed.**
* **Ask questions – chances are your leaders and friends can answer whatever it is that you’re curious about. What are the sleeping rooms like? What about showers? Is the food OK?**
* **Pray about your trip. Ask God to bring peace into your heart as you look forward to your departure. Turn your concerns over to God and lean into that little feeling of excitement that is living just beneath your worry.**

###### **Pray**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Let’s close in prayer**

**God, we are feeling so many things about our trip to \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. You know what’s in our hearts. Sometimes we worry so much it just makes us more anxious. Help us to find comfort knowing that you’re with us. Give us courage to face the unknown. Hold us tight as we grow closer to you through every challenge. It’s going to be OK. Thanks for that, God. Amen**



### Pre-Trip Devotion \#3

######

###### Supplies Needed

One battery-operated spotlight/flashlight

Rice Krispies treats for snack

###### Icebreaker: Searchlight

*First rounds, have batteries removed from flashlight. Replace batteries for second set of rounds.*

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**We’re going to play a classic hiding game using this flashlight/nightlight** *(Show them the light – make sure you’ve removed the batteries)*.

**One of you will hide this light. You can hide it anywhere in the building/room.** *(whatever works best for your situation)*. **You have 1 minute to find a place. After one minute come back here and, everybody else will head out to seek the light.&nbsp; If you find the light, shout I FOUND THE LIGHT very loudly so everybody knows it’s time to come back here.**

**We’ll play a few rounds.&nbsp; Who wants to hide the light first?**

*Play two rounds of the game*

**SAY**:&nbsp; **Now we’re going to play the game but this time we’ll turn the light on.** *(Put the batteries in the light)* **You have to leave it lit as you hide it. You can’t cover it with anything. But you can hide it anywhere in the building.**

**Who wants to hide it first?**

*Play two rounds with the light turned on.*

###### **Talk about the Game**

ASK:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Was hiding it harder or easier when the light was turned on? Was finding it harder or easier when the light was turned on?**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Obviously, it was easier to find the light when it was turned on, right?&nbsp; We could play this game in lots of ways to prove just how much LIGHT helps us find things. We could turn off all of the lights in the building and then search for the unlit light. It would be ridiculously hard to find. Then we could leave the whole building dark, and hide the light turned on. It would be even EASIER to find than before.**&nbsp;

###### **Reflect**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Light is good.**

**In Genesis, it says:**

***3**&nbsp;And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.&nbsp;**4**&nbsp;God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness.*&nbsp;

###### **Discuss**

* What is good about light?

###### **Scripture**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Let’s look at our Bible passage. Who would like to read Matthew 5:14-16?**

***14**&nbsp;“You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.&nbsp;**15**&nbsp;Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.&nbsp;**16**&nbsp;In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.*

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Jesus said, “You are the light of the world.” YOU. YOU are the LIGHT OF THE WORLD. Think about what that means for each of us.**

**Step one: God created light.**

**Step two: God said light was good.**

**Step three: God created you.**

**Step four: Jesus said you are the light of the world.**

**This all goes to say – YOU are the GOODNESS in the world.**

**When you serve others, when you let your light shine, YOU are the goodness that God creates.**

**That’s pretty amazing, don’t you think? You might think you’re just one person…insignificant…not capable of great things. But that’s not true. You are God’s goodness in the world. &nbsp;And when you combine your light with the light of others your goodness multiplies.**

SAY: &nbsp;**So as you get ready for Workcamp, remember that you are part of something good and something big. You will be joining with a mighty force of light this summer to do remarkable things. You will bring light and love and goodness to people who need it.**&nbsp;

**What you are getting ready to do this summer is important. It matters. You ARE the light of the world**.

###### **Food for Thought**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**You know we love a theme-related snack! We’ve heard that Rice Krispies treats glow under a black light. Full transparency – we haven’t actually tried it. But if you have a black light available, see if it’s true and let us know! Even if it’s not true, enjoy some delicious Rice Krispies treats, right?**

**And as you snack on your marshmallow goodness, I want to give you a few things to think about:**

* **God created you and placed a light within you that is good**
* **Sometimes, you may feel moody and not interested in shining your light – that’s normal, and that’s ok**
* **But don’t lose sight of your special light**
* **Don’t hide your light; sharing it with people is part of the power of God in the world**
* **One day this week, wake up early enough to watch the sun rise. Appreciate how the world slowly comes into view and thank God for *everything***

###### **Pray**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**Let’s close in prayer.**

**God of light, thank you for putting goodness in our hearts. When we find ourselves in darkness – when we’re confused, or lost, or angry, or hurt – show us the way back to your light and your love. Remind us that our light has power through you.&nbsp; Energize us to shine so that we can be part of something great and know that we are part of your amazing plan in the world.&nbsp; Amen**



### Pre-Trip Devotion \#4

###### Supplies Needed

Lots of paper or plastic cups – 5-10 per participant

Ice cream and toppings for snack (sprinkles, whipped cream, cherries, nuts) plus bowls and spoons

###### Icebreaker: Flipping Out

SAY:&nbsp; **We need to break into two teams for our opening game.** *(Break them into teams).* &nbsp;**We are going to spread cups all over the room – with no care about how they land.** *(Put the cups on the floor all around the room. Just casually toss them around so the cups are on their sides, as well as upright and upside down).*

**When I give you the signal, TEAM 1 will work to put the cups upright, with the opening facing the ceiling.&nbsp; TEAM 2 will work to put the cups upside down, with the opening facing the floor.**

**You can’t move the cups from their original location; all you can do is adjust the way they sit. You have two minutes to get as many cups set the way you need them.**

**Both teams will be working at the same time, so it’s going to get a little crazy.&nbsp; Be gentle with each other.&nbsp; No injuries, no property damage, people!**

**Ready to play? I’m setting the time for 2 minutes…GO!**

*Play the game for 2 minutes.*

SAY:&nbsp;&nbsp;**&nbsp;&nbsp;**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**OK, teams collect the cups that your team “won”** *(TEAM 1 collect the upright cups, TEAM 2 collect the upside down cups).* **Count your cups. Which team won?**

###### **Talk about the Game**

ASK:&nbsp; **Have you ever tried to do something and it seemed like other people prevented you from making progress?** *Share your experience.*

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**That game was all about things being right side up or upside down. &nbsp;In life, we tend to think there is a “right” way to do certain things. But sometimes not everybody agrees about what is right. That can create conflict; but it can also bring about change in a good way.**

###### **Reflect**

**Do you consider yourself to be open-minded, or are you unlikely to change how you see the world?**

###### **Discuss**

* Is there anything you do “upside down” when compared to most other people? (for example, you might start reading a magazine from the back, or eat dessert before your main course, or complete a test from the last question to the first, etc.). Give time for sharing.

**There are times when you need to follow proper order of operations (sounds like math class!). But in many cases, it is healthy and refreshing to try something a new way.&nbsp; It can help shift your perspective and you might appreciate something in a brand new way.**

Keep that in mind as we hear today’s Scripture reading.

###### **Scripture**

SAY:&nbsp; **Who would like to read John 13:34-35?**

***34**&nbsp;“A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another.&nbsp;**35**&nbsp;By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.”*

SAY:&nbsp; **Hearing Jesus say that we are to love one another isn’t upside down to us. We hear it all of the time. Loving our neighbors is basic Christianity, right? Jesus 101.**

**But in that passage, Jesus calls it a new command. That means Jesus was challenging people to look at each other in a new way. This was fresh news, folks.**

**Before Jesus arrived, people were just living for themselves. They did whatever it took to take care of themselves, without much regard for other people. So when Jesus came on the scene, people were shook. Who *was* this man who preached about forgiveness and love? Who *was* this man who spent his time offering compassion, spending time with social outcasts, and healing the sick and lost?**

**Jesus taught by example.&nbsp; He wanted his followers to love all people – including their enemies. Jesus turned their perspective upside down.**

**The end of the passage from John says that people will know we follow Jesus by how we love other people.&nbsp; They’ll know a Jesus follower not by how many times they go to church, how well they know the Scriptures, or how much they give; a Jesus follower *loves* people the way Jesus loves people.**

###### **Food for Thought**

SAY:&nbsp; **Our snack today/tonight is an opportunity to try something upside down. We’ll make ice cream sundaes – ice cream, chocolate sauce, caramel, sprinkles, and a cherry. But before we eat, we’re going to flip them upside down and eat them from the bottom!**

SAY:&nbsp; &nbsp;**While you’re getting your sundaes and savoring the cold, creamy magic, I want you to think about a few things:**

* **The arrival of Jesus transformed the world not only in his time, but forever**
* **Jesus turned our ideas upside down – ideas about people, about justice, about equality, about women, about children, and about God.**
* **We are getting ready to head out to Workcamp. To a lot of people, it seems upside down to PAY MONEY to help people. We’re so used to working to MAKE MONEY … why would we pay money to work? How would you explain that to somebody if they questioned your decision to go to Workcamp?**
* **While you’re at Workcamp, you may find yourself challenged to see things and people in a new way.**
* **The people you meet will know you are a Jesus follower because of the way you *love others*. That’s what Workcamp is all about.**

###### **Pray**

SAY:&nbsp;&nbsp; **Let’s close our time with prayer.**

**Loving God, thank you for turning our world upside down. We know we are called to love our neighbors. Open our hearts to what you have planned. Open our minds to new ideas. Open our arms so that we can embrace all people the way Jesus taught us. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to serve. May all we say and all we do, honor you.&nbsp; Amen** &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
