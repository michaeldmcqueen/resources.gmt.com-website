**Icebreaker: Camp superlatives**

Welcome back! We’ve just come back from an amazing time at camp, where we learned how God equips us to face life’s big moments. To start off today, we are going to play Camp Superlatives.

Go around the circle and vote on who is the most likely to fit each of these superlatives the best (feel free to add any that would be unique to your group!):

* Most Care Cards Written
* First One to be awake in the morning
* Last One to be awake in the morning
* Always helping someone else
* Most likely to lose their mission handbook
* Most likely to pray for a stranger
* Most likely to win 9 square
* Most coffee consumed
* Always had the snacks

&nbsp;

That was a fun way to look back at some of the memorable moments from camp! Each of those superlatives reminds us of the unique ways we experienced camp and how we each played a part in making it meaningful. But camp wasn't just about the fun moments, it was about serving others and growing closer to Jesus.

As we step back into our daily routines, we don’t want to just leave camp behind as a fun memory. Instead, we want to take the lessons and tools we received and apply them to our lives.

Let’s review our themes scripture from camp:

&nbsp;

**Scripture: 2 Corinthians 9:8** “And God is able to bless you abundantly, so that in all things at all times, having all that you need, you will abound in every good work.”

As we go about our lives or step into new opportunities, this scripture reminds us that God’s provision is perfectly timed and perfectly measured for what He calls us to do. The tools we learned at camp are not just for our *survival,* but so that we may *abound* in every good work.

&nbsp;

**Scripture: Matthew 7: 24-25** “Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock.”

**Ask and discuss:**

* What does this passage tell us about God?
* What does this scripture tell us about ourselves?
* Which tool or tools do you find yourself using the most since camp has ended?
* What are some things that might distract you from staying equipped? How can we keep a firm foundation in Jesus through the distractions?

  &nbsp;

**Closing thought:** Just like in sports or music, where practice prepares us for big moments, our time at camp was preparing us for how we can live out our faith every day. The steps we learned at camp, E.Q.U.I.P., are not just for a one-time experience, they are tools to help us grow and live out our faith every day.

**Pray:** Dear God, Thank You for Your endless love. Help us step forward in faith, knowing that Your grace will always be enough. We come before you with open hearts to do Your will, seeking Your guidance, strength, and peace. Remind us that you have equipped us and teach us how to continually follow you better. Help us prioritize you and make you the center of our lives. Amen
