> At Group Mission Trips, we’re passionate about creating **a safe and meaningful experience for every participant**. To maintain the highest level of care and protection, we require the following screening steps for all adult participants.

### **Who This Applies To**

All participants **age 18 and older** who are registered for a Group Mission Trips event must:

* Complete a **national background check**, and
* Have **authorization from their pastor or ministry leader** submitted to Group Mission Trips **at least 30 days before** the event begins.

---

### **Administering Background Checks**

The background check process is managed by each **church or participant**. It must be completed by a **qualified background check provider** and include, at minimum:

* A **Multi-State Criminal Record/Sexual Offender Search**
* A **Social Security or Identity Verification**

*Tip:* Many churches already partner with a trusted provider for youth ministry volunteers—these services often meet or exceed our requirements.

---

### **Record Retention**

Your church must **retain a copy** of each completed background check for **six years** from the date of the event.<br>This timeline matches the **statute of limitations in Colorado** for civil claims of child sexual abuse.

If an allegation of misconduct is ever made, these records must be readily available for review.<br>This requirement applies **even if the participant or church does not attend future mission trips.**

---

### **Authorization Process**

Group Mission Trips requires that a **lead pastor or authorized ministry leader** confirm that screenings have been completed for every adult participant.

* No individual may authorize their own screening.
* All authorizations must be completed **no later than 30 days before** the event begins.

---

### **Adult Leader Disqualification**

To ensure the safety of everyone involved, the following findings on a background check will result in **automatic disqualification** from participation (without exception or review):

* Any behaviors, traits, or tendencies that could pose a threat to minors or others
* Any form of **sexual misconduct** or conviction related to sexual crimes
* **Felony convictions for violent acts** within the last 10 years
* **Drug-related convictions** (use or distribution of controlled substances) within the last 10 years
* **Property crime convictions** within the last 10 years

*Important:*<br>We cannot make exceptions to these requirements—even in cases of claimed rehabilitation or personal transformation.

However, churches **do not need to disclose specific details** of background check results to Group Mission Trips.<br>Other non-disqualifying offenses will not automatically prevent someone from attending.

If you’re unsure about a participant’s eligibility, **contact Group Mission Trips** for guidance.

---

### **Age of Documentation**

Background checks must be **no older than two (2) years** from the start of the mission trip.

If an existing check is more than two years old, a **new background check** is required before participation.

When a pastor or ministry leader completes the screening authorization, they affirm that, **to the best of their knowledge**, no disqualifying offenses have occurred since the last check.
