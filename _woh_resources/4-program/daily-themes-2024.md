### ​​​**Theme: Influencer**

Make-up tips, viral videos, and giving away large amounts of money to complete strangers are a few ways young people have found themselves becoming famous, influential, and extremely wealthy. Along with social media, we’re all influenced by the people around us through news, music, work, school, sports, and basically anywhere we direct our attention. Whether we think so or not, everyone is an influencer in some way or another. Everything we do is watched by our friends, family, peers, and others around us, making an impression and having influence.

Our goal with the program this year is to help students navigate the many influences in their lives and encourage them to look toward Jesus, the greatest influencer of all time, so they use their influence to positively change their culture. Romans 12:2

***Week of Hope will combine some of these days below as there is not a program Friday. This will be updated once the program has been completed.***&nbsp;

**Sunday: Pattern. (Romans 12:2) Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.** Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.

**Monday: Conformed. (Mathew 26: 31-35 & 69-75)** Peter falls to society’s pressures the way we all do so often. Sometimes standing up for what we believe in can be hard and it feels easier to go with the flow, but Jesus calls us to live in Him.

**Tuesday: Transformed. (John 2: 1-5)** When we are focused on Jesus, He can transform us in incredible ways. Mary sets a perfect example of transformation. Mary went from young and afraid to a strong woman with unshakeable faith.

**Wednesday: Renewed. (Luke 19: 1-10)** To be renewed means to start again. Zacchaeus has a complete change of heart when he meets Jesus. Jesus welcomes his transformation the same way he encourages ours.

**Thursday: Tested. (Luke 23: 32 - 43)** The Bible is full of amazing stories and people. Today, we will look at several stories of people with radical faith that influenced many. But what do these people all have in common? The Bible never calls them out by name. Yet, their faith has gone on to influence others for centuries.

**Friday: Approved. (Acts 16: 13-15)** Our faith was never meant to be hidden. Paul and Lydia are wonderful examples of using our faith to positively influence others in big and small ways. Sometimes our small acts of Jesus' love go further than we know.&nbsp;
