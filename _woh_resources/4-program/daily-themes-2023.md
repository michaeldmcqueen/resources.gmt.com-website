### ​​​Theme: Illuminate

### SUNDAY KICKOFF PROGRAM

##### Illuminate

**Theme Verse: “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.” – John 1:5**

In everyday life, illuminate just means to light something up; like your phone screen when you’re scrolling way past bedtime, or when your flashlight saves you from tripping on a tree root at night. But biblically, Illuminate means more. Jesus says in John 8:12, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness.’

Jesus is the Light that darkness can’t defeat. That’s the story we’ll live out together this week and when you return home.

### SUNDAY NIGHT PROGRAM

**“Jesus Illuminates our Fear to Reveal His Truth”**

Matthew 12:22-33

Immediately, Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowd. After he had dismissed them, he went up on the mountainside by himself to pray. Later that night, he was there alone, and the boat was already a considerable distance from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it. Shortly before dawn Jesus went out to them, walking on the lake. When the disciples saw him walking on the lake, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost,” they said, and cried out in fear.)

Jesus immediately said to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.” “Lord, if it’s you,” Peter replied, “tell me to come to you on the water.” “Come,” he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”

Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him. “You of little faith,” he said, “why did you doubt?” And when they climbed into the boat, the wind died down. Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”

Peter had courage to step out of the boat. For a moment, he walks on water! But when he sees the waves, fear takes over… and he starts to sink. Here’s what I love: Jesus doesn’t yell at him for doubting. Jesus didn’t scold him for being afraid; He illuminated Peter’s fear to show him truth: that faith shines brightest when we look to Jesus.

### MONDAY PROGRAM

**“Jesus Illuminates our Sin to Reveal His Grace”**

Romans 3:23-24

‘For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and all are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus.’

‘And all are justified freely by his grace.’ That means God gives us something we could never earn. Freely. Even when we sin. Even when we fall short. God saw the darkness and loved us enough to do something about it. He sent Jesus, his only Son, to take our place. Jesus lived a perfect life, and then he was crucified. Nailed to a cross so that we could be forgiven. Jesus took the punishment that we deserved.

That’s the heart of grace. Grace isn’t something we can earn or work our way toward. It’s God saying, ‘I love you anyway.’ Even though we’ve sinned, even though we’ve fallen short. Jesus stepped in, paid the price, and brought us back to the light.

It’s completely unfair in the most amazing way. We don’t deserve to be forgiven, yet God forgives us. We don’t deserve his love, yet he loves us. We don’t deserve light, yet he shines it into our darkness.

### **TUESDAY MORNING PROGRAM**

**“Jesus Illuminates our Heart to Reveal His Holiness”**

Proverbs 4:23

“Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it.”

This verse from Proverbs is wisdom from Solomon. He’s saying that your heart is the source of your life. It’s where your thoughts, emotions, choices, and faith all begin.

Our next is David’s prayer in Psalm 51. This one’s personal because David wrote it after one of his darkest moments. He had failed miserably, but instead of hiding from God, he turned toward him.

Psalm 51:10

“Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.”

If our hearts are unguarded, anything can influence us. Things like fear, comparison, guilt. But when we guard our hearts with God’s truth, his light filters everything that comes in. It’s like keeping a clean lens on a flashlight; the clearer it is, the brighter the beam.

And that’s what these verses are about, creating a pure heart. Jesus illuminates our hearts to reveal his holiness. When his light shines in us, he doesn’t just expose the mess, he transforms it.

### WEDNESDAY PROGRAM

**“Jesus Illuminates our Life to Reveal His purpose.”**

Romans 8:28

**‘And we know that in all things God works for the good of t**hose who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.’

This scripture reminds us that all things work together for good, not just the easy things, but all things. That includes the hurt, the confusion, the waiting, the regret. When you love God, even the moments that seem meaningless can become part of something beautiful later.

Some of you might not see it yet, and that’s okay. Maybe right now, you’re in the middle of the chapter that doesn’t make sense. But one day, you’ll look back and say, ‘Oh… that’s what you were doing, God.’

### THURSDAY PROGRAM

**“Jesus Illuminates our Service to reveal His Glory”**

Matthew 5:14–16

“You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.”

That’s what this week has been about. To shine not so we look good. But to shine so God does. Every act of service has been a light on a hill. Visible, real, shining in a way that points people straight to Jesus.
