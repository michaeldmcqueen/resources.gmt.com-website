### ​​​**Theme: Forged**

We all know the destruction and pain that fire can bring, but God also presents fire as purifying and refining throughout Scripture. So why would God choose fire to refine us? It separates the impurities and leaves what is valuable. Friend, when God brings or allows the fiery furnace of discomfort in our lives, it does not burn indiscriminately. It burns intentionally to make us more like Him. We can trust that it is always for our refinement and never for our destruction.

Each day we'll explore how God forges our faith. Through each powerful, transformational mission trip experience, your group will see how God wants us to know we're justified through faith and given access to his perfect peace and grace (Romans 5:1-4). Join us this summer as we explore how we're all FORGED by faith\!

More information on daily themes will be available early 2023…
