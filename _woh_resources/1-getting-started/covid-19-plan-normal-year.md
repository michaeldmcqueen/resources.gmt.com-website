Camp season is quickly approaching, and weâ€™re hard at work preparing to make summer 2023 as fun, safe, and as normal as possible. It's too early to tell what 2023 will hold, but we are prepared to implement our Covid-19 plan if necessary. We will know more in the spring of 2023.

The safety of the students, adults, staff, and residents of the communities we serve is of critical importance. We are in contact with our partners in each community and working to ensure we provide the safest environment and follow all local guidelines when it comes time for camp this summer.

Please check back in the spring of 2023 to see all updates to our Covid-19 plan.&nbsp;
