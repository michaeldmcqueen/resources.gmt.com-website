## Group Mission Trips’ Screening Requirements:&nbsp;

* Participants that are 18 years of age or older (even students) need to have a national background check on file at your church. These background checks cannot be any older than 2 years from the start of your Group Mission Trip event.

* The check must be clear of 1) Having any traits or tendencies that could pose any threat to children, youth, or others 2) Sexual misconduct including crimes resulting in conviction 3) Violence against another person resulting in a felony conviction within the last 10 years 4) Use/distribution of illicit drugs or controlled substances resulting in conviction in the last 10 years 5) Property crime resulting in conviction in the last 10 years

* Pastor’s signature required: Once background checks are completed, log in to your customer account and click on Forms/Screening and Verification. Type in those participants' names, their background check organization, and date the check was run. Enter your pastor's name and email address on that screen and click the "Send Authorization Message" button. Your pastor will receive an email to authorize the adults that you listed. You will receive a confirmation email when you pastor has authorized those participants. This needs to be completed at least 30 days before your event starts.

### If your church is NEW to background checks, we recommend…&nbsp;

You may use *any* organization for background checks, just make sure they run national/multi state checks. If you need a recommendation, we like Clear Investigative Advantage\!&nbsp;

They are super easy to work with and offer a great price. Call them to set up a church/organization account (they do not have a sign-up or annual fee) and tell them you are serving with Group Mission Trips\! Their “Basic Starter” package offers a very affordable background check and meets our requirements.

It’s best to call them to set up your account, Clear Investigative Advantage can be reached at 888-242- 2503 option 2.&nbsp;

Plan ahead\! Setting up an account with any background check organization takes time\!&nbsp;

#### Another Background Check Option:

**Not a church or organization?&nbsp;**

There is a provider online that appears reliable that individuals can use to run “instant” background checks: [Criminal Watch Dog](https://www.criminalwatchdog.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
