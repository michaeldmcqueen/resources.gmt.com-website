**Nashville, TN&nbsp;**&nbsp;-&nbsp; Soles for Souls: bring any old/new footwear. They break down old shoes or redistribute new shoes to communities who needs them, here or overseas. Old shoes are made into other things. Or school supplies for the Dream Center to supply inner-city schools with supplies.<br>&nbsp;
