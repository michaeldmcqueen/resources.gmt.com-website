### Community Gift

Each camp location has shared a *specific need* in their community.<br>Your group’s mission: **have fun collecting as much of that item as you can—and bring it to camp!**

Check your **customer account → Helpful Resources → “Schedule, Menu, and Packing”** to see your camp’s requested item.

Your gift meets a *real need* right where you’ll serve—thank you in advance for your generosity!

*Tip:* Involve your congregation, friends, and even local businesses in the effort.<br>*Transportation tight?* You can always purchase your community gifts once you arrive.

### **What Not to Bring**

Let’s keep our focus clear and our environment safe. Please **leave these at home**:

* Alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs
* Expensive clothes or jewelry
* Anything valuable
* Fireworks, weapons, or toy guns
* Skimpy or revealing clothes

  Please bring clothing that’s appropriate in all settings (longer shorts, t-shirts, modest swimsuits, etc.).

### **Cell Phones, iPods, Laptops, etc.**

For security reasons, it’s best to leave these items at home.<br>We get it—they’re great for capturing memories and keeping in touch—but **don’t let them distract you** from the people and purpose around you.

“How can you be tethered to your devices and expect God to work in unexpected ways?”

If you do bring them, please keep them put away during programs (unless it’s part of the program experience) and on project sites.
