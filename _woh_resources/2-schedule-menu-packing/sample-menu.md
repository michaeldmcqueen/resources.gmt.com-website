If you have a participant who has to eat gluten-free, please let us know. We have a few gluten-free options, but we need to know in advance so that we can ensure we have enough items available.&nbsp;

Please note that we have peanut butter on our menu.&nbsp;

Group Mission Trips (GMT) understands there are many people with dietary restrictions and food allergies. We want our staff and participants to work together to provide a safe environment for anyone with food restrictions.&nbsp;

**DIETARY RESTRICTIONS:**

* If a participant has a food allergy or restriction, their trip leader should ensure they’ve seen Group Mission Trips’ Sample Menu. They can see what will be served each day and decide what supplemental meals/snack items they’ll need to bring.
* If a participant must eat gluten-free, please let GMT know either by calling or via a message in the Special Notes section of the customer account before &nbsp;camp.
* If a participant needs to bring supplemental meals or snacks to accompany the GMT menu, there cannot be a reduction in registration fees since GMT purchases food in bulk. Camp staff *will* assist by providing space for additional food in the kitchen or another designated storage area.
* If the food allergy is severe, the youth leader should notify GMT either by calling or putting a message in the Special Notes section of the customer account before camp. Depending on the severity, the participant may need to be assigned to a crew with another person from their group who understands their food restrictions. The participant should inform the rest of their crew about their food restrictions too, should an emergency arise.
* Participants need to bring any medication they need (ie EpiPens).
* Participants may want to bring their own small cooler to keep their lunch separate from the others on their crew.
* GMT staff will be able to provide ingredient information before each meal at camp. There will be signs posted in the cafeteria each day at camp that list vegetarian options, please see the next page for those.
* If you have any questions, please feel free to call us at 844.258.9616.
