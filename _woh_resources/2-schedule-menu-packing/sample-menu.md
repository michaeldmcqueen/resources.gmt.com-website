(All meals are subject to change based on location and availability.)

At Group Mission Trips, meals are prepared by one of our summer staff members and you! Your youth group will be assigned one or more meal shifts, and your participants will help prepare meals for the rest of camp. It’s good, hearty food—served cafeteria-style! While it may not be restaurant dining, we promise it will keep your crew energized for a full day of serving.

\- Main Items: French toast, sausage, English muffins, eggs, cheese, biscuits and gravy, or bacon

### Dietary Restrictions & Food Allergies

We know that every participant’s health matters. Our goal is to work together to keep everyone safe and well-fed.

If a participant has a food allergy or restriction:

· Trip leaders should review this Sample Menu with participants so they can plan supplemental meals or snacks.

· Contact Group Mission Trips before camp for gluten-free or other dietary needs.

· No registration discount applies for bringing personal food, but storage space will be provided.

Severe allergies: Notify Group Mission Trips in advance. Make a note in your customer account under Special Notes for special requests. Participants may be paired with someone from their group who understands their needs. Bring necessary medication (like an EpiPen) and consider a small personal cooler. Please note that we do have peanut butter at camp.

GMT staff will be able to provide ingredient information before each meal at camp. There will be signs posted in the cafeteria each day at camp that list vegetarian options, please see the next page for those.
