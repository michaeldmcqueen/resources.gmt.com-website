Group Mission Trips understands there are many people with dietary restrictions and food allergies. We want our staff and participants to work together to provide a safe environment for anyone with food restrictions.&nbsp;

**DIETARY RESTRICTIONS:**

* If a participant has a food allergy or restriction, their trip leader should ensure they’ve seen Group Mission Trips’ Sample Menu. They can decide what supplement meals/snack items they’ll need to bring.
* If a participant must eat gluten-free, please let Group Mission Trips know either by calling or by logging a note under Special Requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;
* If a participant needs to bring supplement meals or snacks to accompany the Group Mission Trips’ menu, there cannot be a reduction in registration fees since Group Mission Trips purchases food in bulk. Camp staff will assist by providing space for additional food in the kitchen or in another designated storage area.
* If the food allergy is severe, the trip leader should notify Group Mission Trips either by calling or by logging a note under Special Requests. Depending on the severity, the participant may need to be assigned to a crew with another person from their own group who understands their food restrictions. The participant should inform the rest of their crew about their food restrictions too, should an emergency arise.
* Participants need to bring any medication they need (i.e. EpiPen). Participants may want to bring their own small cooler to keep their lunch separate from the others on their crew.
* Camp staff will be able to provide ingredient information prior to each meal at camp. There will be signs posted in the cafeteria each day at camp that list vegetarian options, please also see the next page for those.
* If you have any questions, please feel free to call us at 844.258.9616.&nbsp;
