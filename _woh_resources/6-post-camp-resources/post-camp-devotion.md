### Post-Trip Devotions

###### **DEVO 1**

**Ice Breaker:** Pass the light

**Materials Needed:** flashlight

**How to Play:**

1\. Have students stand or sit in a circle and turn off or dim the lights.

2\. Hand the flashlight to a student and start a timer or play music for 15 seconds.

3\. Once the timer begins, the students will pass the flashlight in a circle.

4\. When the timer or music stops, the student holding the flashlight must share their favorite memory or moment from camp.

**Ask and Discuss:**

\- Was it stressful or exciting waiting for the light to land on you?

\- Did passing the light feel slower or faster than you expected?

\- Where was everyone’s attention when the light was being passed?

In the game, the light didn’t stay still or stay hidden. It was always visible, moving from person to person, lighting up the circle even in our dark room. And when someone was holding the light, it naturally drew everyone’s attention. At camp, many of us experienced God’s light in powerful ways. For some, it brought clarity. For others, comfort. For some, conviction or a new sense of purpose. What we experienced at camp wasn’t just for that one week. It was preparation for what comes next. Jesus tells us that his light is meant to be carried into the world.

Life doesn’t slow down. School resumes. Responsibilities return. Distractions get louder. It can be easy to think the light fades—but the truth is, the light doesn’t disappear. We’re called to keep shining it, even when our environment or circumstances change.

**Scripture:** Matthew 5: 14-16 “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.”

**Ask and Discuss:**

\- What does this scripture tell us about God?

\- What does this scripture tell us about ourselves?

\- What are some ways you might be tempted to dim the light?

\- How can we keep God’s light shining bright?

**Closing Thought:** Now that we are back from camp, it might feel easier to put the light away. To blend back in. To stay quiet about what God did. But Jesus says his light isn’t meant to be hidden. It is meant to shine where people can actually see it. That doesn’t mean being loud or perfect. It means living differently in small, intentional ways: choosing kindness, serving others, forgiving quickly, or standing firm in your faith when it’s uncomfortable. As we step back into everyday life, remember that the light you carried at camp is still with you. Keep passing it, keep shining it, and trust that God will use it exactly where you are.

**Prayer:** God, thank you for shining your light on us. Help us not to hide our faith or dim the gifts You’ve given us, but to let Your love shine through everything we do. Teach us to live in a way that points others to You -- through our words, our actions, and the way we treat people. Give us courage to stand out and to reflect Your light in every situation. May our lives shine so brightly that others see Your goodness and give glory to You alone. Amen.

<br>**DEVO 2**

**Ice Breaker:** Noticing the Light

**How to Play:**

1\. Ask students to look around the room and start naming every source of light they can find. (Ex. Overhead lights, lamps, exit signs, windows, phone screens, etc.) They can name them out loud.

2\. Keep naming light sources until the group has noticed them all.

**Ask and Discuss:**

\- What light source(s) was the most obvious? Least obvious?

\- Did anyone notice a light that no one else saw?

\- Did you notice all of the same lights before you were asked to look for them?

Most of the light in this room was already on, you just didn’t notice it until you started looking for it. That’s often how God’s light works. It doesn’t disappear, we just stop looking for it. And when we stop noticing it, we often stop responding to it. If we aren’t paying attention, we can miss what he’s doing or calling us to do. We are called to walk in the light, but walking in the light requires staying aware of where God’s light is shining.

At camp, it may have felt easier to walk in the light. Your faith may have felt stronger, community felt supportive, and distractions were fewer. In our day to day lives, walking in the light can feel harder because real life gets busy and messy. But God doesn’t stop inviting us to walk with him just because the setting changes. Walking in the light doesn’t mean living perfectly. It means choosing honesty instead of hiding, connection instead of isolation, and obedience instead of avoidance. When we walk in the light, we stay close to God and close to one another—and that’s where growth happens.

**Scripture:** 1 John 1:7 -- But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all sin.

**Ask and Discuss:**

\- What does this scripture tell us about God?

\- What does this scripture tell us about ourselves?

\- What does it mean to walk in the light compared to just noticing it?

\- What is one small step you can take this week to notice God’s light?

**Closing Thought:** Camp is over, but his light hasn’t faded. He is still present, still guiding, and still inviting us to walk with him. Walking in the light doesn’t mean having everything figured out. It means choosing, again and again, to notice where his light is shining and taking the next step toward him.

**Prayer:** God, thank You for being the Light who never turns off. Thank You for meeting us at camp and for continuing to walk with us now that we’re home. Help us remember that Your light hasn’t disappeared—we just need to slow down and pay attention. Teach us how to walk in Your light each day, even when life feels busy, distracting, or uncertain. Give us eyes to notice where You are already at work and courage to take the next step You’re inviting us into. Amen
