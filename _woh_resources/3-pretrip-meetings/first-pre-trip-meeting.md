**Say:** Welcome to our Mission Trip Meeting! We are heading to **(your mission trip location)** this summer during **(your dates)**. This experience is going to be life-changing—full of adventure, meaningful relationships, powerful moments with Jesus, and the opportunity to serve people in real need. You’re going to make memories that last a lifetime and friendships that go far beyond this trip!

Before we dive into details, let’s get a visual of what this trip is all about.

**(Play** [**Group Week of Hope promo video**](https://youtu.be/Oi-FcAsrr8g){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} **or the** [**Youth Expectations Video**](https://vimeo.com/300595208){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} **(both under Helpful Resources)**

**Optional**: Invite a couple of students or adults who have been on past mission trips to briefly share one highlight from their experience.

### **Icebreaker Game: “Mission Match-Up!”**

##### **Instructions:**

* **Hand everyone a card as they enter.**<br>Half the cards describe a **community-service situation** (like “Sorting food at the pantry for 2 hours”), and the other half describe the **matching positive impact** (like “A family receives groceries that same afternoon”).
* When you say, **“Let’s Bring Hope!”**, everyone stands up and **walks around to find the card that matches theirs**.
* Once matched, each pair **introduces themselves** and shares **one thing they’re excited about for Week of Hope**.
* Choose **2–3 pairs** to read their card pairs out loud to show how **every act of service—big or small—creates real impact**.

**Leader Line to Wrap It Up:**

**Say:**<br>“Just like in this game, Week of Hope will bring real challenges—early mornings, long tasks, unexpected moments—and real rewards. We’ll meet incredible people, form new relationships, and make a real difference in the community. Both sides matter, and together, they make serving at Week of Hope so meaningful!”

### **Inviting Others**

**Say:** This mission trip isn’t just for us—it’s an amazing opportunity to get your friends involved in something meaningful. Grab one of the flyers and think of one person you can personally invite. You never know whose life might change because you invited them to serve!

### **Introductions & Trip Itinerary**

**Say:** Let’s walk through some important details to make sure everyone knows what to expect:

* **Dates & Times:** Here are our departure and return dates. Please pull out your phones and get these on your calendars now.<br>*(Project a calendar on the screen for a visual.)*
* **Tuesday Evening Free Time:** On Tuesday evening, we’ll have free time. We’ll be forming a small team of volunteers to research fun, safe options and bring suggestions to the group.
* **Lodging:** We’ll be staying at (location). Using the Lodging Information and Packing List from our Group account, we’ll go over what you need to bring and what the sleeping arrangements look like.
* **Code of Conduct:** This is extremely important. Every participant must read and understand the Group Mission Trips Code of Conduct before signing the participant form. This keeps everyone safe and focused on our mission.
* **Camp Attire:** We don’t have a dress code but many of our project sites do. We ask that everyone wear modest clothing so that we can serve those projects.
* **Financial Info:** The total cost per participant includes transportation, registration, and free time expenses. Our payment schedule will need to be ahead of the GMT deadlines (March 1 and May 1). We will also discuss fundraising opportunities to help cover costs.
* **Community Gift:** Our camp location has requested certain donation items. (Show list.) As a group, we will decide how to collect and bring these items with us.
* **Background Checks:** Every participant 18 or older by the start of camp (including students) must complete a national criminal background check. We’ll make a list today of who that applies to and set a timeline to complete them.

### **Ways You Can Participate in Programs**

**Say:** One of the most exciting parts of this trip is the evening and worship programs. There are several opportunities for you to be involved:

* **Worship Team:** If you play an instrument or sing, you can join the camp music team! The Song List is available in our account.
* **Drama & Scripture:** You can be part of a drama, read Scripture, or lead prayer during evening programs.
* **Lip Sync Battle:** On Thursday night, there will be a lip-sync battle at camp! If you want to try out for the show, talk to me about your act. ( You will need to approve their act before they show it to staff at camp).
