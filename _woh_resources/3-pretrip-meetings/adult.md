Welcome to the Adventure!

First of all—thank you!<br>You’re giving your time, energy, and heart to help teenagers experience a life-changing week of faith and service. Because of you, they’ll grow closer to God, make lasting memories, and discover what it truly means to live out love in action.

So buckle up—this week is going to be unforgettable!

### **Our Statement of Faith**

We believe the Bible is the inspired, authoritative Word of God. We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, in his virgin birth, in his sinless life, in his death on the cross, in his bodily resurrection, in his ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in his personal return. We believe people receive forgiveness of sins and eternal life through Jesus.

That’s the foundation for everything we do.

### **Our Story**

It all started in the early 1990s with a simple mission: *to serve communities and connect people with Jesus through hands-on service.*

From those humble beginnings, Group Mission Trips—part of the non-profit ministry Group Cares—has grown into a movement. Together, volunteers like you have served millions of hours helping people across the U.S. and beyond.

Through it all, one thing has never changed:

We believe the best way for teenagers to encounter Jesus is by serving others—across town or across the globe.

That legacy continues with you.

### **Our Home Base**

We’re based in beautiful Fort Collins, Colorado, but our mission reaches far beyond state lines.

---

### **Our Mission**

To serve others through home repair and community service experiences that transform communities and help participants, residents, and partners grow closer to Jesus.

---

### **Our Priorities**

Connecting people with Jesus is the number one goal of Group Mission Trips, and we also focus on the following priorities:

* Safety
* Faith-building activities
* Meaningful projects

---

### **FAQs (a.k.a. What You’re Probably Wondering)**

Why Group Mission Trips?<br>Because everything—from housing to projects to worship—is already planned. That means you can focus on what really matters: walking alongside your students on their faith journey.

### **What’s My Role?**

You’re more than a chaperone—you’re a mentor, encourager, and example of Christ’s love.

Here’s what that looks like:

* Be a positive role model for teens from all over the country
* Work together with both your group and your work crew throughout the trip
* Cheer students on—but don’t do the work for them
* Ensure your group is where they are supposed to be and when they are supposed to be there
* Stay alert for anything unsafe or concerning

### **What Kind of Work Will I Do?**

Be ready to tackle any project and expect to interact each day with local partners from the community. Projects could include working with children at a day camp, serving at a food bank or homeless shelter, leading a Vacation Bible School, assisting the elderly, tutoring struggling kids, working with disabled children, facilitating a sports camp, and/or serving churches and other human service organizations. Typically a crew works at one, at the most two, project sites during the week

### **Who’s on My Crew?**

Each person is assigned to a six-person crew that usually includes one adult and five teens, all from different churches.<br>This mix helps build leadership, friendships, and a sense of wider community.

(If you have questions about this process or have specific requests, please give us a call. If needed, we are happy to keep your group together, but still on work crews of 6 people.)

### **Where Will I Stay?**

You'll likely stay in a local church- simple but full of heart!

Expect:

* Sleeping on a twin air mattress, cot, or pad (whatever YOU bring)
* Shared space with up to 100 mission-minded youth and adults
* Limited A/C – many facilities simply don’t have it
* Limited hot water. Local facilities do their best, but we have a lot of participants!
* Limited shower facilities. Most churches don’t have them, so we have to get creative. They may be down the street at a YMCA or we might have shower tents constructed outside the churches. They may or may not have hot water
* Be prepared for communal living…. there may not be a whole lot of privacy

**Pro tip:** Earplugs, flip-flops for showers, and an extension cord make a big difference!

### **What Should I Bring?**

Your trip leader will provide a full list, but highlights include:

* Twin-sized air mattress or cot (no doubles or queens)
* 5-gallon water jugs and family-sized coolers (one of each per six people)
* First-aid kit for each vehicle

### Your Key Responsibilities

* Know and follow the daily schedule
* Be an encourager; your attitude sets the tone
* Participate fully in programs and devotions and ask your students to join you in this journey. Be on hand after programs and devotions for those who may need more attention
* Keep youth supervised and safe at all times
* Report inappropriate or unsafe behavior immediately
* Treat everyone with respect and dignity
* Model modesty and discuss expectations beforehand
* Ensure your driver’s license and insurance are current (if driving)
* Follow the Code of Conduct—it applies to everyone

### Handling Discipline

Everyone agrees to the same Code of Conduct.

If an issue arises:

1. Address it calmly and privately, never in front of others.
2. Talk with the youth leader if it involves another group.
3. Contact Group Mission Trips staff if you need support.

### **Your Role on the Work Crew**

* Be part of the team, not the boss
* Let students take the lead as Devotion Leader or Partner Coordinator
* Keep an eye out for safety concerns—no horseplay!
* Always know where every crew member is
* Encourage hydration and teamwork
* Be the crew’s chief encourager—celebrate every win!

### **A Typical Day at Camp**

Your youth leader will have the full schedule, but here’s the overview:

* Evening 1: Meet your crew and get your project assignment
* Each Day: Morning & evening programs + lunch crew devotions
* Adult Meetings: Sunday and midweek check-ins with staff (mandatory)
* Free Time: Most afternoons + a free Tuesday evening (Dinner is on your own)
* Lights Out: 11:00 p.m. (midnight on the final night!)
* Final Day: Clean up, load up, and say your goodbyes

### **Other Important Details**

Adult Requirements

* National background check (within two years of trip start)
* Comfortable with communal living and youth supervision
* Respect separate shower times for minors and adults
* Always supervise—project contacts do *not* count as adults
* Never reprimand a student publicly
* Avoid one-on-one situations—always have a third person present
* Bring your sense of humor and positive spirit!

### **Phones & Internet**

* Keep phones put away during work and program times (unless it’s part of the program experience)
* Wi-Fi and cell service may be limited
* The camp office has a phone for emergencies

Encourage students to **disconnect from screens and connect with people**—that’s where real growth happens.

### **Valuables**

Please leave valuables at home or locked in your vehicle. Group Mission Trips is not responsible for lost or stolen items.

### **Extra Adults?**

Extra adults interested in serving on staff can apply for one of Group Mission Trips’ many volunteer “Red Shirt” staff positions. Although these adults don’t count toward your group’s required 1 to 5 adult ratio, they do attend camp for free! For details or questions, call Group Mission Trips’ Staffing Team at 1.844.258.9616 or go to GroupMissionTrips.com and click on About Us and then Join Our Team.

### **Safety & Medical Emergencies**

If an emergency occurs:

1. Call 911 immediately.
2. Notify the mission trip office.
3. Staff will contact the youth leader and assist with transportation and care.

For minor injuries:

* Use the crew’s first-aid kit or the vehicle kit.
* Review safety rules daily—never cut corners.
* Youth under 16 may use power drills (for screws only) but not saws or hole-drilling. No one under the age of 18 can use a power saw.
* Carry your insurance card (or a copy).
* Local clinics and hospitals are already notified that we’re in town.
