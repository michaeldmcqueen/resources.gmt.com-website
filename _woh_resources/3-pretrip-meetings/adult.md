> THANK YOU for accepting the responsibility of providing teenagers a life-changing week to grow closer to God. We appreciate you taking your time to serve others. Now get ready for an unforgettable and transforming experience!

**\*\*OUR STATEMENT OF FAITH:**&nbsp;\*\*

We believe the Bible is the inspired, authoritative Word of God. We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. We believe in the deity of Jesus Christ, in his virgin birth, in his sinless life, in his death on the cross, in his bodily resurrection, in his ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in his personal return. We believe people receive forgiveness of sins and eternal life through Jesus.&nbsp;

**\*\*OUR HISTORY:**&nbsp;\*\*

With humble beginnings going back to the early 1990s, Group Mission Trips has been working with and helping communities across the United States and the world. As the non-profit mission ministry of Group Cares, we work hard to bring meaningful service to the communities we serve. Since our beginning, thousands upon thousands of mission trip participants have racked up millions of volunteer hours serving people in need.&nbsp;

All these years later, one constant remains true: We strongly believe in providing opportunities for teenagers to encounter Jesus through serving others either in their own backyard or halfway across the globe. The Group Mission Trips legacy of lasting impact continues…&nbsp;

**\*\*FAQs:\*\***

Why Group Mission Trips?

Our mission trip experiences are expertly planned from start to finish allowing you time and space to walk with your students on this incredible faith journey

What is my role?

* Be a positive, role-model for teens from all over the country
* Work together with both your church group and your work crew throughout the trip
* Rally round students to do their best, without doing it for them
* Ensure your group is where they’re supposed to be and when they’re supposed to be there
* Always be on the look-out for any unsafe situations

What type of work will I do?

Be ready to tackle any project and expect to interact each day with local partners from the community. Projects could include working with children at a day camp, serving at a food bank or homeless shelter, leading a Vacation Bible School, assisting the elderly, tutoring struggling kids, working with disabled children, facilitating a sports camp, and/or serving churches and other human service organizations. Typically a crew works at one, at the most two, project sites during the week

Who will be on my work crew? Who am I with during the day?

Each person is assigned to a six-person crew; typically consisting of one adult and five youth...each from different churches. It has been our experience that when groups allow Group Mission Trips to mix participants up to make crews, individuals develop social and leadership skills, make new friends, and develop a closer bond with their resident and their own youth group. If you have questions about this process or have specific requests, please give us a call. If needed, we can keep your group together, but still on work crews of 6 people

Where will I live?

* Generally at a local church. Participants sleep on the floor using either a twin-sized air mattress, cot, or whatever YOU bring
* With up to 100 like-minded mission focused youth leaders and youth from all around the country
* Don’t expect:
  * Air conditioning- many facilities simply don’t have it
  * Private, hot showers. Most churches don't have them, so we have to get creative. They may be down the street at a YMCA or we might have shower tents constructed outside the churches. They may or may not have hot water
  * Lots of privacy. Remember, this is communal living

What should I bring?

Your youth leader will have the full list but here are a few highlights:

* Most likely a twin-sized mattress or cot (NO double or queen size). Double check with your trip leader
* We ask groups to bring a 5–gallon water jug and a family–size cooler (preferably on wheels) for every 6 people in the group. Each crew will need these at their project sites each day for cold water and lunch
* A good first aid kit, one for each vehicle your group brings

What are my responsibilities?

Your primary youth leader may assign you specific jobs or roles, but generally speaking, you’ll want to:

* Be familiar with the schedule
* Be an encourager! Bad attitudes and complaining are contagious. Encourage one another and be a good example, you set the tone for most everything that happens
* Participate in programs and meditate on the devotions –and ask your students to join you in this journey. Be on hand after programs and devotions for those who may need more attention
* Be the adult leader at the project site. You are responsible for knowing where the youth are on your crew at all times. Never leave youth unattended or let them leave the project site unattended. Know what is happening at your project site and take the leadership role
* Report any and all inappropriate actions. If you ever feel uncomfortable, report your concerns to Group Mission Trips staff right away
* Treat all students and adults with equal respect
* Respectfully enforce what participant wear within your group. (The leaders in your group should discuss what is appropriate prior to the mission trip- modesty is key!)
* If you are a driver, ensure your license and insurance are up to date. Confirm everyone in your vehicle is wearing a seatbelt
* Abide by Group Mission Trips’ Code of Conduct. Both adults and youth have been sent home for violating their agreement to follow this code.

How do I handle discipline issues?

* Everyone has agreed to the same Code of Conduct. Group Mission Trips relies on adults to be the primary enforcer of these standards within your group and crew
* If you experience code violations or other issues from outside your group, talk with that person and their youth leader directly
* Group Mission Trips staff are available to assist if needed

What is my role on my crew?

* Avoid being the primary decision maker, encourage kids to tackle projects and decisions as a crew. Youth make excellent devotion leaders and partner coordinators, if possible let them take on these crew roles. Partner together as an equal member of the team. Be the lead encourager to all!
* Safety first! Stay alert for hazards and unsafe situations. Discourage horseplay. Messing around is the number one reason participants get injured at a mission trip
* Know where your crew members are at all times. No one should ever be alone, work all together or with buddies
* Drink plenty of fluids and encourage youth to do likewise

What will my days look like?

Your youth leader will have access to the daily schedule, but here are a few highlights:

* Programs and devotions:
  * First evening program- receive project assignment and meet your crew
  * Each day- morning and evening programs, devotions to do with your crew during lunch time and devotions to do with your youth group before bed
* Adult meetings (mandatory):
  * Sunday and usually mid-way through camp- a meeting to touch base with Group Mission Trips staff
* Free time:
  * Each afternoon after returning from your project site
  * Tuesday evening- this is your time to spend as you wish with your youth group. Dinner is on your own
* Lights out:
  * 11 pm each night except midnight on the last night
  * Everyone needs sleep so please ensure your group is in their room by the lights-out time
* The final day:
  * Everyone will be cleaning and loading up. Group Mission Trips staff will check you out

**\*\*OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION:\*\***

Requirements for adults:

* Each participant that is 18 and older needs to have a national background check on file at their church that is no older than 2 years from the start of the trip. Your pastor will digitally sign Group Mission Trips’ Screening and Verification Form confirming that you are cleared to attend. Your trip leader should be connecting with you to discuss your church’s process
* Be okay with supervising youth and sleeping in tight quarters, typically on the floor
* There are separate shower times for those individuals 17 and younger from those that are 18 and older. Adults will ensure these separate times are met and help others in your group find a time that works best
* Adult drivers will drive their crew to their project site each day
* Adults must always provide supervision at the sites. Service partners do not qualify as a supervising adult. Never leave your crew alone and do not ignore unacceptable behavior on the project site or at the lodging facility
* Adults should never reprimand a student in front of the group. Deal with the situation directly, but away from other kids
* Avoid compromising situations. Always have a third person present when meeting with a student or driving with a student
* Be ready to participate and have loads of fun!

Phones and internet:

* If you bring your cell phone, we ask that it not be used during programs (unless it’s part of the program experience) or while working at your project site
* Don’t count on wireless internet service being available
* There may or may not be cell phone service at your location
* The mission trip office will have a phone for office use and emergencies only

Valuables:

Please leave valuables at home or locked in your vehicle. Group Mission Trips is not responsible for lost or stolen items

Extra adults above the 1 to 5 ratio:

Extra adults interested in serving on staff can apply for one of Group Mission Trips’ many volunteer “Red Shirt” staff positions. Although these adults don’t count toward your group’s required 1 to 5 adult ratio, they do attend camp for free!

Safety and medical emergencies:

* If a severe injury occurs at the project site, call 911 immediately and then notify the mission trip office. Group Mission Trips staff will then notify the participant’s youth leader, take the participant’s signed release form to the hospital and arrange supervision for the other participants in the crew
* If the injury or illness is not severe, the adult can call the mission trip office for assistance. Group Mission Trips staff will notify the participant’s youth leader and help arrange transportation of the injured or ill person to a hospital or other appropriate health-care facility, and arrange supervision for the other participants in the crew
* If the injury or illness is minor, it may be treated at the site. Each crew is provided a small first aid kit containing basic supplies. In addition, you should have a more complete first aid kit in your vehicle
* Before working, all participants should thoroughly review project site safety precautions. Participants are not required to do any work that they consider unsafe. (Participants can use a drill to put screws in, but no one under the age of 16 can use a power tool/drill to drill holes and no one under the age of 18 can use a power saw)
* Participants are asked to bring their insurance card or a legible copy and carry it with them at all times
* Local health care facilities have been notified that participants will be working in their community
