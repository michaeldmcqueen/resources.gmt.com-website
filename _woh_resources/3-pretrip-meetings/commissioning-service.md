##### **Scripture Reading: John 1:1-18**

&nbsp;

**LEADER:** In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was the Light of all humanity. That Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness cannot extinguish it. As you go on this mission trip, you are not just doing work—you are carrying the Light of Christ into places in need of hope, healing, and truth.

**TEAM MEMBERS:** We go to reflect the true Light of Christ so that others may see Him through our service, our presence, and our love.

**CONGREGATION:** The Light has come. We send you to shine.

**TEAM MEMBERS:** We go to be fully present with those we will serve—listening, learning, and loving as Christ first loved us.

**CONGREGATION:** The Light shines in the darkness. We send you to carry that Light.

**TEAM MEMBERS:** We go not in our own strength, but as bearers of the Word made flesh—Jesus, who dwells among us full of grace and truth.

**CONGREGATION:** We commit to pray that the Light of Christ will shine through you.

**LEADER:** As the body of Christ here at \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, we dedicate ourselves to pray specifically and continually for each mission team member. We stand with you as you go to illuminate communities with the hope and presence of Jesus.

**CONGREGATION:** As you go, we go with you. We will lift you in prayer so that through you, God’s Light may be seen, known, and received.

**LEADER AND CONGREGATION:** May the grace, truth, and Light of our Lord Jesus Christ go before you, surround you, and work through you on this mission. May every encounter reflect the glory of the One who came to bring light to the world.

**TEAM MEMBERS:** We love you, Lord. Let your Light shine through us.

**ALL:** Amen. Let there be light!

### **Prayer of Dedication**

Lord Jesus, True Light who gives light to everyone, illuminate our hearts that we may carry Your presence. As we go, let Your Word dwell in us richly. May we be living reflections of Your grace and truth, so that all who encounter us may encounter You. Amen.

### **Optional Enhancements for Commissioning**

• Produce a handout with the names of each member of the mission team to give to the congregation and invite them to pray for the team.

• You could also include the daily themes (in your customer account) and scriptures so the congregation will know what the mission trip participants will be studying each day as they serve.
