### **Welcome and Theme Intro**

**Say** something like:

“Hey everyone—first of all, thank you! Seriously. Our teens couldn’t experience this kind of life-changing trip without you. And here’s the thing—this trip is bigger than any one of us. It’s bigger than our church, our plans, or even the projects we’ll work on. God’s doing something amazing through Group Mission Trips—He’s shaping hearts and drawing people closer to Jesus. And YOU get to be part of that.”

This summer’s theme, *Illuminate*, invites us to see Jesus as the unstoppable Light that shines through every part of life—school, sports, friendships, and everything in between.

When we invite him into all of it, we discover that we’re right where he wants us to be—living out our purpose. In a world full of pressure, noise, and distraction, *Illuminate* helps students experience real faith, real connection, and real joy as they learn to carry his Light wherever they go. *(John 1:1–18)*

You might add:

“Our goal as adults is to help students not just *hear* about Jesus, but *see* him in action—through us, through their teammates, and through the people we serve.”

### **Theme Activity:**

**Say:** As we prepare for this mission trip, I want us to lean more into our theme: *Illuminate***.** Light has purpose—it reveals, it guides, it brings warmth and clarity. Our role on this trip is not to be the brightest light in the room, but to be steady lights that help teenagers see Jesus more clearly through how we serve, lead, and care for them.

This experience will be full of powerful moments, but it will also be full of challenges—long days, early mornings, minimal rest. Light can dim when it’s not cared for. So, before we even arrive, let’s talk about how we will keep our lights shining.

&nbsp;

##### **<u>Illuminating Through Renewal</u>**

**Say:** Just like a lamp needs to be plugged in to stay lit, we need to stay connected to our source—physically, emotionally, and spiritually. When we’re tired or overwhelmed, our light can flicker, and the teens can sense that. That’s why recharging isn’t optional—it’s essential for us to shine.

**Activity – “Light Source Ideas”:**<br>Around the room are posters labeled with different parts of the trip: morning, work site, mealtimes, free time, evenings. Write down simple ways you can “recharge your light” during those times—whether it’s taking a quiet moment to pray, stepping outside to breathe, grabbing a cup of coffee alone, or journaling. Post your ideas and we’ll look at them together.

**Say:** When you need to step away to refuel, speak up. Protecting your light helps you illuminate others. A dim, exhausted leader can’t reflect the love of Christ the way a rested one can.

##### **<u>Illuminating Through Connection</u>**

**Say:** On this trip, we’ll be surrounded by teenagers—bright, passionate, energetic lights of their own. Some may shine boldly, while others feel hidden or unsure. Our role is to help their lights grow brighter—not by overpowering them, but by encouraging them to lead, to serve, and to discover the ways God has already placed light within them.

**Activity – “Light Builders or Light Blockers?”**<br>In small groups, you’ll be given cards with real-life scenarios (see the end of this meeting for some examples). Some reflect actions that dim a teenager’s light through control or criticism. Others show ways to help their light shine through encouragement and guidance. Discuss the differences and share what it looks like to be a light-builder rather than a light-blocker.

**Say:** Thank you for those insights. Remember, the trip is *not* about adults being in charge—it’s about students stepping into the light God has given them. Let them lead prayers, take responsibility at project sites, share reflections. You will still ensure safety and boundaries, but your guidance should illuminate their path—not overshadow it.

Also, let’s be mindful that how we interact matters. Any behavior or comment that could be misinterpreted can dim trust quickly. Always choose clarity, care, and respect so your presence reflects the light of Christ without confusion.

##### **<u>Illuminating Through Presence</u>**

**Say:** Finally, I want to remind you of this—light isn’t loud. It doesn’t demand attention. It simply shines. You were invited to serve on this trip because you already carry that light. You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to be present.

These teenagers are some of the most hopeful, resilient people you’ll ever meet. They believe God can use them—and that kind of faith is contagious. As you shine your light, you’ll help them see God’s love more clearly. And as they shine, they will illuminate the world around them in ways we may never fully see this side of heaven.

So, let’s stay connected to our source, protect our light, and be ready to illuminate every space we step into.”

### **Tips for Being a Great Adult**

**Say:** OK, now let’s chat about what this week is going to be like and how we can be the best adult leader possible. Mission trips are awesome but let’s be real, they can be exhausting. Long days, big emotions, early morning, late nights. <br><br>· How can we recharge or find mini moments of downtime?

(Write ideas on the whiteboard. Examples: morning coffee chats, quick prayer walks, naps during free time, journaling) Discuss the importance of hydration, sleep, and staying healthy.

**Say**: You’ll be surrounded by teens—our own and others from all over the country! Different backgrounds, different personalities, same big hearts. Let’s remember- this trip is about the teens. Our role is not to control but to encourage and guide. Let them take the lead on projects and devotions. We are here to support, not direct.

· How are some ways we can connect with the teens on our trip?

(Write ideas on the whiteboard. Examples: ask open ended questions, listen more than you talk, join their activities like paint with them, laugh with them, encourage teamwork and celebrate small wins)

**Say**: Now let’s talk about safety. This is a big one. We never want anything we do or say to make a teen feel uncomfortable. That means avoiding off-color jokes, physical contact that could be misinterpreted, or comments that could come across as inappropriate. When in doubt, error on the side of caution. Let’s chat about a few situations that could arise and how we would handle those situations.

· Maintaining healthy boundaries (Examples: alone with a camper, sleeping arrangements, shower situations, physical touch that is appropriate vs. could be perceived as inappropriate)

· Appropriate use of phones and social media on the trip (Examples: posting videos/photos of youth, and those not from your group, befriending/following minors)

· Encouraging and affirming teens without favoritism (Examples: ensure that you are not spending “extra” time with a youth that could be construed as inappropriate, affirm equally)

**Say**:  And finally—relax! You’ve got this. You’re about to spend a week with some of the most inspiring people on earth—teenagers! They’re full of energy, passion, and optimism. They truly believe they can change the world (and honestly, they can). Our job is to cheer them on, help them grow, and enjoy the ride.

&nbsp;

Add a few reminders:

* Be flexible—plans *will* change.
* Smile often; laughter builds connection faster than anything.
* Keep the main thing the main thing: Jesus.

“Let’s close in prayer.”

**Prayer:**<br>God, thank you for these incredible adults who are giving their time, energy, and hearts to serve you and our teens. As we prepare for this trip, help us to illuminate you through renewal, connection, presence—trusting that you’ve already equipped us for what’s ahead.
