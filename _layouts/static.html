				<h4>DEPOSITS, PAYMENTS AND CANCELLATIONS</h4>
				<p>Starting October 31st*, a $50 deposit per person is required to register. This deposit is non-refundable and does not go towards your balance due if a cancellation occurs.</p>
				<p>After registering by paying deposits, there are 2 payment dates:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>March 15th*: 50% of the remaining balance is due</li>
					<li>May 15th*: Final balance is due**</li>
				</ul>
				<p><em>**The $50 deposit, per person, is nonrefundable upon registering. The rest of the fee is refundable until May 15th*, as long as the Group Mission Trips registration team is notified of a cancellation by that date via phone or email. There are no refunds after May 15th*.</em></p>
				<p><em>If payment is not received by the payment dates, spaces may be cancelled to accommodate people on the waitlist.</em></p>
				<p><em>*Payment periods referred to are in the 6-months leading to the upcoming trip.</em></p>
				<p><strong>PARTICIPANT AGE REQUIREMENTS </strong><br />ADULT PARTICIPANTS Must be at least 21 years old at time of trip.<br />JUNIOR HIGH/SENIOR HIGH TRIPS: Participants must be at least 11 years old or entering the 6th grade in the fall of the same year as your trip.<br />SENIOR HIGH TRIPS: Participants must be at least 14 years old or entering the 9th grade in the fall of the same year as your trip.</p>
				<p><strong>ADULT RATIO REQUIREMENTS </strong><br />Groups must bring a minimum of 1 adult (must be at least 21 years old) for every 5 participants that are under 21. If both males and females are registered, the group needs to have at least 1 male adult and 1 female adult so there is supervision at night.</p>
				<p><strong>BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIREMENTS </strong><br />Every participant that is 18 or older (students too!) must be screened and have a current (within the last two years) national background check on file at the church. Group Mission Trips requires a pastor’s digital signature on their screening and verification form for every participant that is 18 or older.</p>
				<p><strong>CREW ASSIGNING</strong><br />Participants are mixed up and placed on 6-person crews during the mission trip--each of these 6 people could possibly be from a different church. It has been our experience that this allows participants to develop social and leadership skills, make new friends, and experience a closer bond with their own group. That being said, a group can request to be kept together on (6-person) crews.</p>
				<p><strong>PRIMARY CONTACT/PARTICIPANT INFO</strong><br />You’ll designate a primary contact for your group, this person will receive all trip communication by mail, email, text, and phone. The primary contact will receive planning resources from GMT, and this person is responsible for reading through and sharing the information to the group. Every participant (or their parent if they are under 18 years old) needs to fill out and digitally sign the participant info form. The primary contact needs to ensure all their participants have filled out the participant form, confirm all their vehicles are listed correctly, make sure all screening and Verification forms are signed, and note any special situations to GMT no later than 30 days before the trip starts.</p>
				<p><strong>TRANSPORTATION</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>All groups must bring adult drivers (21 years of age of older) with vehicles that can be used the entire time to transport crews to and from project sites.</li>
					<li>Vehicles with a minimum capacity of six (with seatbelts) are requested.</li>
					<li>If your group charters a bus, it must be available to transport participants to and from work sites. *Please check your trip location to make sure bringing a bus is permissible.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>TOOLS/SUPPLIES </strong><br />GMT will provide a detailed “Packing List” and a “Tool List” for Workcamps.<br />Workcamp groups should expect to bring items such as ladders, painting supplies, and construction tools including circular saws, electric drills, and hammers in order to complete projects.</p>
				<p>Week of Hope groups should expect to bring water jugs, coolers, and work gloves. There may also be an optional supply list.</p>
				<p><strong>SCHEDULE</strong><br />It’s critical for all participants to be in attendance from start to finish. Arriving late or leaving early negatively impacts the experience. Plan to arrive for check-in on the first day and stay to check-out on the final day.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you leave a mission trip in progress, it will result in loss of the entire trip fee. No refunds will be issued.</li>
					<li>We reserve the right to add, cancel, or change a trip, including location, itinerary, and participant age requirement.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>WORKCAMPS FLEX</strong><br />If attending any of our trips listed as Workcamps Flex, Group Mission Trips will provide a picnic-style lunch at your worksite each day but will not provide lodging, breakfast, or dinners for the week.<br /><br /><strong>INTERNATIONAL MISSION TRIPS/PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS</strong><br />Group Mission Trips does not operate international mission trips. We refer those that would like to serve internationally with trusted partner organizations that can safely and effectively run those trips. The term "partner" does not imply any responsibility toward Group Mission Trips for trips organized by other organizations. Any information we collect through our website on behalf of international mission trip inquiries will be shared with partner organizations for the sole purpose of the requested inquiry.</p>
